Welcome to the new C++ Programming Language Website: https://cpp-lang.net!

## Why?

I think C++ deserves its own all-in-one website that should contain
most recent and valuable information for both beginners and advanced programmers.

## Goals

My goal is to provide:
- [tutorials](/learn) that are as easy to understand for beginners as it is possible
but teach a modern and proper way to use C++.
- [documentation](/docs) with examples that is easy to read but contain most recent
and correct information about C++ language, its standard library and possibly other libraries too
- [tools](/tools) knowledge base with tutorials
- [community](/community) list of popular C++ community groups, blogs, etc.

## Contribute

Help is needed. Regardless of my willingness I can't do everything by myself.
If you think that this project is worth your time and you're able to help, please
consider creating a [pull request](https://github.com/Cpp4You/CppLangNet/pulls) with your work.

:::important Remember
The number one rule is to create content easy to understand. Try to put yourself in the place
of a person that just started programming or doesn't even know yet what programming is about.
