Assigns a new value to an existing variant object.

1) <br/>
Copy-assignment:
* If both `*this` and rhs are valueless by exception, does nothing.
* Otherwise, if `rhs` is valueless, but `*this` is not, destroys the value contained in `*this` and makes it valueless.
* Otherwise, if `rhs` holds the same alternative as `*this`, assigns the value contained in `rhs` to the value contained in `*this`. 
If an exception is thrown, `*this` does not become valueless: the value depends on the exception safety guarantee of the alternative's copy assignment.
* Otherwise, if `the` alternative held by `rhs` is either nothrow copy constructible or not nothrow move constructible 
(as determined by `std::is_nothrow_copy_constructible` and `std::is_nothrow_move_constructible`, respectively), 
equivalent to `this->emplace<rhs.index()>(get<rhs.index()>(rhs))`. `*this` may become `valueless_by_exception` if an exception is thrown on the 
copy-construction inside emplace.
* Otherwise, equivalent to `this->operator=(variant(rhs))`.

This overload is defined as deleted unless `std::is_copy_constructible_v<T_i>` and `std::is_copy_assignable_v<T_i>` are both true 
for all `T_i` in `Types...`. This overload is trivial if `std::is_trivially_copy_constructible_v<T_i>`,
`std::is_trivially_copy_assignable_v<T_i>` and `std::is_trivially_destructible_v<T_i>` are all true for all `T_i` in `Types...`.

2) <br/>
Move-assignment:
* If both `*this` and `rhs` are valueless by exception, does nothing
* Otherwise, if `rhs` is valueless, but `*this` is not, destroys the value contained in `*this` and makes it valueless
* Otherwise, if `rhs` holds the same alternative as `*this`, assigns `std::get<j>(std::move(rhs))` to the value contained in `*this`, with `j` being `index()`. 
If an exception is thrown, `*this` does not become valueless: the value depends on the exception safety guarantee of the alternative's move assignment.
* Otherwise (if `rhs` and `*this` hold different alternatives), equivalent to `this->emplace<rhs.index()>(get<rhs.index()>(std::move(rhs)))`. 
If an exception is thrown by `T_i`'s move constructor, `*this` becomes valueless_by_exception.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if `std::is_move_constructible_v<T_i>` and `std::is_move_assignable_v<T_i>` are both true for 
all `T_i` in `Types...`. This overload is trivial if `std::is_trivially_move_constructible_v<T_i>`, 
`std::is_trivially_move_assignable_v<T_i>`, and `std::is_trivially_destructible_v<T_i>` are all true for all `T_i` in `Types...`.

3) <br/>
Converting assignment.
* Determines the alternative type `T_j` that would be selected by overload resolution for the expression `F(std::forward<T>(t))` if there was an overload of 
imaginary function `F(T_i)` for every `T_i` from `Types...` in scope at the same time, except that:
An overload `F(T_i)` is only considered if the declaration `T_i x[] = { std::forward<T>(t) };` is valid for some invented variable `x`;
* If `*this` already holds a `T_j`, assigns `std::forward<T>(t)` to the value contained in `*this`. If an exception is thrown, `*this` does not become valueless: 
the value depends on the exception safety guarantee of the assignment called.
* Otherwise, if `std::is_nothrow_constructible_v<T_j, T> || !std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<T_j>` is true, equivalent to `this->emplace<j>(std::forward<T>(t))`.
`*this` may become valueless_by_exception if an exception is thrown on the initialization inside emplace.
* Otherwise, equivalent to `this->emplace<j>(T_j(std::forward<T>(t)))`.

This overload participates in overload resolution only if *`std::decay_t<T>` (until C++20) / `std::remove_cvref_t<T>` (since C++20)* is not the same 
type as variant and `std::is_assignable_v<T_j&, T> is true and std::is_constructible_v<T_j, T>` is true and the expression `F(std::forward<T>(t))` 
(with `F` being the above-mentioned set of imaginary functions) is well formed.
```cpp
std::variant<std::string> v1;
v1 = "abc"; // OK
std::variant<std::string, std::string> v2;
v2 = "abc"; // Error
std::variant <std::string, bool> v3;
v3 = "abc"; // OK, chooses string; bool is not a candidate
std::variant<float, long, double> v4; //holds float
v4 = 0; // OK, holds long; float and double are not candidates
```

### Parameters
`rhs`	-	another variant
`t`	-	a value convertible to one of the variant's alternatives
### Return value
`*this`

### Exceptions
1) May throw any exception thrown by assignment and copy/move initialization of any alternative. <br/>
2) noexcept specification:  <br/>
`noexcept(((std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<Types> &&
           std::is_nothrow_move_assignable_v<Types>) && ...))` <br/>
3) noexcept specification:  <br/>
`noexcept(std::is_nothrow_assignable_v<T_j&, T> && std::is_nothrow_constructible_v<T_j, T>)`
