```cpp title='Since C++17'
inline constexpr std::allocator_arg_t allocator_arg = std::allocator_arg_t();
```
```cpp title='Since C++11'
struct allocator_arg_t { explicit allocator_arg_t() = default; };

constexpr std::allocator_arg_t allocator_arg = std::allocator_arg_t();  // Until C++17
```

std::allocator_arg_t is an empty class type used to disambiguate the overloads of constructors and member functions of allocator-aware objects,
including [std::tuple](/docs/std/utility/tuple), <Until v='cpp17'>[std::function](/docs/std/utility/functional/function), 
[std::packaged_task](/docs/std/thread/packaged_task),</Until>and std::promise. std::allocator_arg is a constant of it.
