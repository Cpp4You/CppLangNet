# std::allocator_traits&lt;Alloc>::max_size

```cpp title="Since C++20"
static constexpr size_type max_size( const Alloc& a ) noexcept;
```
```cpp title="Since C++11, Until C++20"
static size_type max_size( const Alloc& a ) noexcept;
```

If possible, obtains the maximum theoretically possible allocation size from the allocator `a`, by calling `a.max_size()`.

If the above is not possible (e.g. Alloc does not have the member function max_size() ), then returns `std::numeric_limits<size_type>::max() / sizeof(value_type)`.

### Parameters
`a`	-	allocator to detect

### Return value
Theoretical maximum allocation size.

### Defect reports
The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
