# std::allocator_traits&lt;Alloc>::allocate

```cpp title="Since C++20"
// 1)
[[nodiscard]] static constexpr pointer allocate( Alloc& a, size_type n );
// 2)
[[nodiscard]] static constexpr pointer allocate( Alloc& a, size_type n,
                                                 const_void_pointer hint );
```
```cpp title="Since C++11, Until C++20"
// 1)
static pointer allocate( Alloc& a, size_type n );
// 2)
static pointer allocate( Alloc& a, size_type n,
                         const_void_pointer hint );
```

		
Uses the allocator `a` to allocate `n*sizeof(Alloc::value_type)` bytes of uninitialized storage. An array of type `Alloc::value_type[n]` is created in the storage, 
but none of its elements are constructed.

1) Calls `a.allocate(n)` <br/>
2) Additionally passes memory locality hint hint. Calls `a.allocate(n, hint)` if possible. 
If not possible (e.g. a has no two-argument member function allocate() ), calls `a.allocate(n)`

### Parameters
`a`	-	allocator to use <br/>
`n`	-	the number of objects to allocate storage for <br/>
`hint`	-	pointer to a nearby memory location <br/>
### Return value
The pointer returned by the call to `a.allocate(n)`

### Notes
Alloc::allocate was not required to create array object until [P0593R6](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p0593r6.html), 
which made using non-default allocator for [std::vector](/docs/std/containers/arrays/vector/) and some other containers not actually well-defined according 
to the core language specification.

After calling allocate and before construction of elements, pointer arithmetic of `Alloc::value_type*` is well-defined within the allocated array, 
but the behavior is undefined if elements are accessed.
