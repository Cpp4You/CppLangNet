Constructs an object in allocated, but not initialized storage pointed to by `p` using OuterAllocator and the provided constructor arguments. 
If the object is of type that itself uses allocators, or if it is [std::pair](/docs/std/utility/pair), 
passes InnerAllocator down to the constructed object.

First, retrieve the outermost allocator OUTERMOST by calling `this->outer_allocator()`, and then calling the outer_allocator() 
member function recursively on the result of this call until reaching an allocator that has no such member function.

Define *OUTERMOST_ALLOC_TRAITS*(x) as `std::allocator_traits<std::remove_reference_t<decltype(OUTERMOST(x))>>`

    1) Creates an object of the given type T by means of uses-allocator construction at the uninitialized memory location indicated by `p`, 
    using OUTERMOST as the allocator. After adjustment for uses-allocator convention expected by T's constructor, 
    calls `OUTERMOST_ALLOC_TRAITS(*this)::construct`.

### Parameters
`p`	-	pointer to allocated, but not initialized storage <br/>
`args...`	-	the constructor arguments to pass to the constructor of T <br/>
`x`	-	the constructor arguments to pass to the constructor of T1 <br/>
`y`	-	the constructor arguments to pass to the constructor of T2 <br/>
`xy`	-	the pair whose two members are the constructor arguments for T1 and T2 <br/>
`non_pair`	-	non-pair argument to convert to pair for further construction

### Return value
(none)

### Notes
This function is called (through [std::allocator_traits](../allocator_traits)) by any allocator-aware object, such as [std::vector](/docs/std/containers/arrays/vector), 
that was given a [std::scoped_allocator_adaptor](../scoped_allocator_adaptor) as the allocator to use. 
Since inner_allocator is itself an instance of std::scoped_allocator_adaptor, this function will also be called when the allocator-aware objects constructed through 
this function start constructing their own members.
