# std::scoped_allocator_adaptor&lt;OuterAlloc,InnerAlloc...>::destroy

```cpp title='Since C++11'
template< class T >
void destroy( T* p );
```
Uses the outer allocator to call the destructor of the object pointed to by `p`, by calling

`std::allocator_traits<OUTERMOST>::destroy(OUTERMOST(*this), p)`

where *OUTERMOST* is the type that would be returned by calling `this->outer_allocator()`, and then calling the outer_allocator() member function recursively on 
the result of this call until reaching the type that has no such member function.

### Parameters
`p`	-	pointer to the object that is going to be destroyed

### Return value
(none)
