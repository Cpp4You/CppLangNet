# std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator&lt;T>::deallocate_bytes

```cpp title='Since C++20'
void deallocate_bytes( void* p,
                       std::size_t nbytes,
                       std::size_t alignment = alignof(std::max_align_t) );
```

Deallocates the storage pointed to by `p`, which must have been allocated from a [std::pmr::memory_resource](/docs/std/memory/memory_resource) `x` 
that compares equal to `*resource()`. using `x.allocate(nbytes, alignment)`, typically through a call to `allocate_bytes(nbytes, alignment)`.

Equivalent to `resource()->deallocate(p, nbytes, alignment)`;

### Parameters
`p`	-	pointer to memory to deallocate <br/>
`nbytes`	-	the number of bytes originally allocated <br/>
`alignment`	-	the alignment originally allocated

### Exceptions
Throws nothing.

### Notes
This function was introduced for use with the fully-specialized allocator <code>[std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator&lt;&gt;](../polymorphic_allocator)</code>, 
but it may be useful in any specialization.
