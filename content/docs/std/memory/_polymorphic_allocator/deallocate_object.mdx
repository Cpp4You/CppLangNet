# std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator&lt;T>::deallocate_object

```cpp title='Since C++20'
template <class U>
void deallocate_object( U* p, std::size_t n = 1 );
```
Deallocates the storage pointed to by `p`, which must have been allocated from a [std::pmr::memory_resource](/docs/std/memory/memory_resource) `x` 
that compares equal to `*resource()`, using `x.allocate(n*sizeof(U), alignof(U))`, typically through a call to `allocate_object<U>(n)`.

Equivalent to `deallocate_bytes(p, n*sizeof(U), alignof(U))`;

### Parameters
`p`	-	pointer to memory to deallocate <br/>
`n`	-	number of objects of type U the memory was for

### Exceptions
Throws nothing.

### Notes
This function was introduced for use with the fully-specialized allocator <code>[std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator&lt;&gt;](../polymorphic_allocator)</code>, 
but it may be useful in any specialization.
