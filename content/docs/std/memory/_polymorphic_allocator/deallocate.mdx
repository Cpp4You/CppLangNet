# std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator&lt;T>::deallocate

```cpp title='Since C++17'
void deallocate( T* p, std::size_t n );
```
Deallocates the storage pointed to by `p`, which must have been allocated from a [std::pmr::memory_resource](/docs/std/memory/memory_resource) `x` 
that compares equal to `*resource()` using `x.allocate(n * sizeof(T), alignof(T))`.

Equivalent to `this->resource()->deallocate(p, n * sizeof(T), alignof(T));`.

### Parameters
`p`	-	pointer to memory to deallocate <br/>
`n`	-	the number of objects originally allocated


### Exceptions
Throws nothing.
