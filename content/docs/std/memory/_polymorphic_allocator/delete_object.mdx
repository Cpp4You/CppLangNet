```cpp title='Since C++20'
template <class U>
void delete_object( U* p );
```

deallocate_object(p);
```

### Parameters
`p`	-	pointer to the object to destroy and deallocate

### Exceptions

### Notes
This function was introduced for use with the fully-specialized allocator <code>[std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator&lt;&gt;](../polymorphic_allocator)</code>, 
but it may be useful in any specialization.
