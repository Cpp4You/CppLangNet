# std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator&lt;T>::destroy

```cpp title='Since C++17, Deprecated in C++20'
template<class U>
void destroy( U* p );
```

Destroys the object pointed to by `p`, as if by calling `p->~U()`.

### Parameters
`p`	-	pointer to the object being destroyed

### Notes
This function is deprecated via [LWG issue 3036](https://cplusplus.github.io/LWG/issue3036), 
because its functionality can be provided by the default implementation of [std::allocator_traits::destroy](/memory/allocator_traits/destroy) and hence extraneous.
