# std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator&lt;T>::allocate

```cpp title='Since C++20'
[[nodiscard]] T* allocate( std::size_t n );
```
```cpp title='Since C++17, Until C++20'
T* allocate( std::size_t n );
```

Allocates storage for `n` objects of type T using the underlying memory resource. <br/>
Equivalent to `return static_cast<T*>(resource()->allocate(n * sizeof(T), alignof(T)));`.

### Parameters
`n`	-	the number of objects to allocate storage for

### Return value
A pointer to the allocated storage.

### Exceptions

Throws [std::bad_array_new_length](/docs/std/memory/new/bad_array_new_length) if `n > std::numeric_limits<std::size_t>::max() / sizeof(T);`  <br/>
may also throw any exceptions thrown by the call to `resource()->allocate`.

### Defect reports
The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
