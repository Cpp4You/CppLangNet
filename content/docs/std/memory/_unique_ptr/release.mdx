# std::unique_ptr&lt;T,Deleter&gt;::release

```cpp
pointer release() noexcept; //(since C++11)

constexpr pointer release() noexcept; //(since C++23)
```

Releases the ownership of the managed object, if any.

`get()` returns `nullptr` after the call.

The caller is responsible for deleting the object.

### Parameters
(none)

### Return value
Pointer to the managed object or `nullptr` if there was no managed object, i.e. the value which would be returned by `get()` before the call.


### Example

<Columns spacing = "20px" columns={['6fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp
#include <memory>
#include <iostream>
#include <cassert>
 
struct Foo {
    Foo() { std::cout << "Foo\n"; }
    ~Foo() { std::cout << "~Foo\n"; }
};
 
int main()
{
    std::cout 
        << "Creating new Foo...\n";
    std::unique_ptr<Foo> up(new Foo());
 
    std::cout 
        << "About to release Foo...\n";
    Foo* fp = up.release();
 
    assert (up.get() == nullptr);
    assert (up == nullptr);
 
    std::cout 
        << "Foo is no longer owned by unique_ptr...\n";
 
    delete fp;
}

```

</div>

<div>

```plaintext title="Result"
Creating new Foo...

About to release Foo...
Foo is no longer owned by unique_ptr...
~Foo
```

</div>
