### Description

Replaces the managed object.

#### 1) 
Given `current_ptr`, the pointer that was managed by `*this`, performs the following actions, in this order:
* Saves a copy of the current pointer `old_ptr` = `current_ptr`
* Overwrites the current pointer with the argument `current_ptr` = `ptr`
* If the old pointer was non-empty, deletes the previously managed object `if(old_ptr) get_deleter()(old_ptr)`.

#### 2) 
Behaves the same as the reset member of the primary template, except that it will only participate in overload resolution if either
* `U` is the same type as pointer, or 
* pointer is the same type as `element_type*` and `U` is a pointer type `V*` such that `V(*)[]` is convertible to `element_type(*)[]`.


#### 3) 
Equivalent to reset(pointer())


### Parameters

`ptr` - pointer to a new object to manage

### Return value
(none)


### Notes
To replace the managed object while supplying a new deleter as well, move assignment operator may be used.

A test for self-reset, i.e. whether `ptr` points to an object already managed by `*this`, is not performed, except where provided as a compiler extension or as a debugging assert. 
Note that code such as `p.reset(p.release())` does not involve self-reset, only code like `p.reset(p.get())` does.


### Example

<Columns spacing = "20px" columns={['6fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
 
struct Foo { // object to manage
    Foo() { std::cout << "Foo...\n"; }
    ~Foo() { std::cout << "~Foo...\n"; }
};
 
struct D { // deleter
    void operator() (Foo* p) {
        std::cout 
            << "Calling delete for Foo object... \n";
        delete p;
    }
};
 
int main()
{
    std::cout 
        << "Creating new Foo...\n";
    std::unique_ptr<Foo, D> up(new Foo(), D());  // up owns the Foo pointer (deleter D)
 
    std::cout 
        << "Replace owned Foo with a new Foo...\n";
    up.reset(new Foo());  // calls deleter for the old one
 
    std::cout 
        << "Release and delete the owned Foo...\n";
    up.reset(nullptr);      
}

```
