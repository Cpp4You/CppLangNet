# std::inout_ptr_t&lt;Smart,Pointer,Args...>::operator Pointer\*, std::inout_ptr_t&lt;Smart,Pointer,Args...>::operator void\*\*

```cpp
// 1)
operator Pointer*() const noexcept;
// 2)
operator void**() const noexcept;
```

Exposes the address of a Pointer or `void*` object to a foreign function which will generally release the ownership represented by 
its value and then re-initialize it.

1) <br/>
Converts `*this` to the address of stored Pointer object.

2) <br/>
Converts `*this` to the address of a `void*` object. This conversion function participates in overload resolution only if Pointer is not same as `void*`, 
and the program is ill-formed if Pointer is not a pointer type.
The initial value of the `void*` object is equal the value of the stored Pointer object converted to `void*`, and any modification 
to it affects the Pointer value used in the [destructor](./~inout_ptr_t). Accessing the `void*` object outside the lifetime of `*this` has undefined behavior.

Once one of these two conversion functions has been called on an [destructor](./~inout_ptr_t) object, the other shall not be called on it, 
otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

### Parameters
(none)

### Return value
1) <br/>
The address of stored Pointer object.

2) <br/>
The address of the `void*` object that satisfies aforementioned requirements.

### Notes

If the object pointed by the return value has not been rewritten, it is equal to the value held by adapted Smart object before construction.

On common implementations, the object representation of every Pointer that is a pointer type is compatible with that of `void*`, 
and therefore these implementations typically store the `void*` object within the storage for the Pointer object, no additional storage needed:

* If the implementation enables type-based alias analysis (which relies on the strict aliasing rule), a properly aligned std::byte[sizeof(void\*)] 
member subobject may be used, and both conversion functions return the address of objects implicitly created within the array.
* Otherwise, a Pointer member subobject may be used for both conversion functions, and (2) may directly returns its address reinterpret_cast to `void**`.

If Pointer is a pointer type whose object representation is incompatible with that of `void*`, an additional bool flag may be needed for recording 
whether (1) (or (2)) has been called.
