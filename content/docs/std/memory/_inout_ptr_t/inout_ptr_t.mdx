# std::inout_ptr_t&lt;Smart,Pointer,Args...>::inout_ptr_t

`Since C++23`
```cpp
explicit inout_ptr_t( Smart &sp, Args... args );       (1)
inout_ptr_t( const inout_ptr_t& ) = delete;            (2)
```

1) <br/>
Creates an [inout_ptr_t](../inout_ptr_t). Adapts `sp` as if binds it to the Smart& member, captures every argument `t` in `args...` as if initializes the 
corresponding member of type `T` in `Args...` with std::forward&lt;T>(t), then initializes the stored Pointer with `sp` if Smart is a pointer type, 
otherwise, initializes it with `sp.get()`. `sp.release()` may be called if Smart is not a pointer type, in which case it will not be called again within 
the destructor.

2) <br/>
Copy constructor is explicitly deleted. [inout_ptr_t](../inout_ptr_t) is neither copyable nor movable.

### Parameters
`sp`	-	the object (typically a smart pointer) to adapt <br/>
`args...`	-	the arguments used for resetting to capture

### Return value
(none)

### Exceptions
May throw implementation-defined exceptions.

### Notes
If Smart is not a pointer type and `sp.release()` is not called by the constructor, it may be called by the destructor before resetting `sp`.

Every argument in `args...` is moved into the created [inout_ptr_t](../inout_ptr_t) if it is of an object type, or transferred 
into the created [inout_ptr_t](../inout_ptr_t) as-is if it is of a reference type.

The constructor of [inout_ptr_t](../inout_ptr_t) is allowed to throw exceptions. For example, when `sp` is an intrusive pointer with a control block, 
the allocation for the new control block may be performed within the constructor rather than the destructor.
