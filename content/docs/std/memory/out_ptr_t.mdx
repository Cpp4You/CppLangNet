# std::out_ptr_t

Defined in header `<memory>`.


```cpp title="C++23"
template< class Smart, class Pointer, class... Args >
class out_ptr_t;
```

out_ptr_t is used to adapt types such as smart pointers for foreign functions that output their results via a `Pointer*` (usually `T**` for some object type `T`) or `void**` parameter.

out_ptr_t captures additional arguments on construction, provides a storage for the result to which such an aforementioned foreign function writes, 
and finally resets the adapted `Smart` object with the result and the captured arguments when it is destroyed.

out_ptr_t behaves as if it holds following non-static data members:

* a `Smart&` reference, which is bound to the adapted object on construction,
* for every `T` in `Args...`, a member of type `T`, which is an argument captured on construction and used for resetting while destruction, and
* a member subobject that suitable for storing a `Pointer` within it and providing a `void*` object, where the `Pointer` or `void*` object is generally exposed 
to a foreign function for re-initialization.

Users can control whether each argument for resetting is captured by copy or by reference, by specifying an object type or a reference type in `Args...` respectively.

### Template Parameters

`Smart`	-	the type of the object (typically a smart pointer) to adapt
`Pointer`	-	type of the object (typically a raw pointer) to which a foreign function writes its result
`Args...`	-	type of captured arguments used for resetting the adapted object

#### Type requirements
* Pointer must meet the requirements of `NullablePointer`.
* The program is ill-formed if Smart is a [std::shared_ptr](../shared_ptr) specialization and `sizeof...(Args) == 0`.

### Specializations
Unlike most class templates in the standard library, program-defined specializations of out_ptr_t that depend on at least one program-defined 
type need not meet the requirements for the primary template.

This license allows a program-defined specialization to expose the raw pointer stored within a non-standard smart pointer to foreign functions.

                />
</SymbolTable>

### Notes
out_ptr_t expects that the foreign functions do not used the value of the pointed-to `Pointer`, 
and only re-initialize it. The value of the smart pointer before adaption is not used.

The typical usage of out_ptr_t is creating its temporary objects by [std::out_ptr](../out_ptr), which resets the adapted smart pointer immediately. 
E.g. given a setter function and a smart pointer of appropriate type declared with
`int foreign_setter(T**);` `and std::unique_ptr<T, D> up;` respectively,
```cpp
int foreign_setter(T**);
std::unique_ptr<T, D> up;
 
if (int ec = foreign_setter(std::out_ptr(up))) {
    return ec;
}
```
is roughly equivalent to
```cpp
int foreign_setter(T**);
std::unique_ptr<T, D> up;
T* raw_p{};
 
int ec = foreign_setter(&raw_p);
up.reset(raw_p);
if (ec != 0) {
    return ec;
}
```

It is not recommended to create an out_ptr_t object of a storage duration other than automatic storage duration, 
because such code is likely to produce dangling references and result in undefined behavior on destruction.

out_ptr_t forbids the usage that would reset a [std::shared_ptr](../shared_ptr) without specifying a deleter, 
because it would call [std::shared_ptr::reset](../_shared_ptr/reset) and replace a custom deleter later.

Captured arguments are typically packed into a `std::tuple<Args...>`. 
Implementations may use different mechanism to provide the `Pointer` or `void`* object they need hold.
