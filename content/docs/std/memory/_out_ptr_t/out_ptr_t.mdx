# std::out_ptr_t&lt;Smart,Pointer,Args...>::out_ptr_t


```cpp title="Since C++23"
// 1)
explicit out_ptr_t( Smart &sp, Args... args );
// 2)
out_ptr_t( const out_ptr_t& ) = delete;
```

1) <br/>
Creates an [out_ptr_t](../out_ptr_t). Adapts `sp` as if binds it to the Smart& member, captures every argument `t` in `args...` 
as if initializes the corresponding member of type `T` in `Args..`. with std::forward&lt;T>(t), then value-initializes the stored Pointer.

2) <br/>
Copy constructor is explicitly deleted. out_ptr_t is neither copyable nor movable.

### Parameters
`sp`	-	the object (typically a smart pointer) to adapt <br/>
`args...`	-	the arguments used for resetting to capture

### Return value
(none)

### Exceptions
May throw implementation-defined exceptions.

### Notes
After construction, the Pointer or void* object pointed by the return value of either conversion function is equal to `nullptr`.

Every argument in `args...` is moved into the created [out_ptr_t](../out_ptr_t) if it is of an object type, or transferred into the created 
[out_ptr_t](../out_ptr_t) as-is if it is of a reference type.

The constructor of [out_ptr_t](../out_ptr_t) is allowed to throw exceptions. For example, when `sp` is a [std::shared_ptr](../shared_ptr), 
the allocation for the new control block may be performed within the constructor rather than the destructor.
