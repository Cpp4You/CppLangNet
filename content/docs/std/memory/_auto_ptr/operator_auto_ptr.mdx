# std::auto_ptr&lt;T>::operator auto_ptr&lt;Y>

`Deprecated in C++11` `Removed in C++17`
```cpp
template< class Y >
operator auto_ptr_ref<Y>() throw();     (1)	

template< class Y >
operator auto_ptr<Y>() throw();         (2)	
```

Converts `*this` to an auto_ptr for a different type `Y`.

1) Returns an implementation-defined type that holds a reference to `*this`. [std::auto_ptr](../auto_ptr) is convertible and assignable from this template. 
The implementation is allowed to provide the template with a different name or implement equivalent functionality in other ways.

2) Constructs a new auto_ptr with a pointer obtained by calling `release()`.

### Parameters
(none)

### Return value

1) An implementation-defined type that holds a reference to `*this`
2) A auto_ptr with a pointer obtained by calling `release()`.

### Notes
The constructor and the copy assignment operator from auto_ptr_ref is provided to allow copy-constructing and assigning [std::auto_ptr](../auto_ptr) from nameless temporaries. 
Since its copy constructor and copy assignment operator take the argument as non-const reference, they cannot bind rvalue arguments directly. 
However, a user-defined conversion can be executed (which releases the original auto_ptr), followed by a call to the constructor or copy-assignment operator that 
take auto_ptr_ref by value. This is an early implementation of move semantics.
