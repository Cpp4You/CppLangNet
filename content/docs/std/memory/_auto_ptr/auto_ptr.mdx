# std::auto_ptr&lt;T>::auto_ptr
Defined in header `<memory>`.

`Deprecated in C++11` `Removed in C++17`
```cpp
explicit auto_ptr( X* p = 0 ) throw();      (1)

auto_ptr( auto_ptr& r ) throw();            (2)	

template< class Y >
auto_ptr( auto_ptr<Y>& r ) throw();         (3)	

auto_ptr( auto_ptr_ref<X> m ) throw();      (4)	
```

Constructs the auto_ptr from a pointer that refers to the object to manage.

1) Constructs the auto_ptr with pointer `p`.

2) Constructs the auto_ptr with the pointer held in `r`. `r.release()` is called to acquire the ownership of the object.

3) Same as (2). `Y*` must be implicitly convertible to `T*`.

4) Constructs the auto_ptr with the pointer held in the auto_ptr instance referred to by `m`. `p.release()` is called for the 
auto_ptr `p` that `m` holds to acquire the ownership of the object.
auto_ptr_ref is an implementation-defined type that holds a reference to auto_ptr. [std::auto_ptr](../auto_ptr) is implicitly convertible to and 
assignable from this type. The implementation is allowed to provide the template with a different name or implement equivalent functionality in other ways.

### Parameters

`p`	-	a pointer to an object to manage
`r`	-	another auto_ptr to transfer the ownership of the object from
`m`	-	an implementation-defined type that holds a reference to auto_ptr

### Notes

The constructor and the copy assignment operator from auto_ptr_ref is provided to allow copy-constructing and assigning 
[std::auto_ptr](../auto_ptr) from nameless temporaries. Since its copy constructor and copy assignment operator take the argument as non-const reference, 
they cannot bind rvalue arguments directly. However, a user-defined conversion can be executed (which releases the original [std::auto_ptr](../auto_ptr)), 
followed by a call to the constructor or copy-assignment operator that take auto_ptr_ref by value. This is an early implementation of move semantics.
