# std::auto_ptr&lt;T>::operator=

`Deprecated in C++11` `Removed in C++17`
```cpp
auto_ptr& operator=( auto_ptr& r ) throw();         (1)	

template< class Y >
auto_ptr& operator=( auto_ptr<Y>& r ) throw();      (2)	

auto_ptr& operator=( auto_ptr_ref<T> m ) throw();   (3)	
```

Replaces the managed object with the one managed by r or m.

1) Effectively calls `reset(r.release())`.

2) Effectively calls `reset(r.release())`. `Y*` must be implicitly convertible to `T*`.

3) Effectively calls `reset(m.release())`. auto_ptr_ref is an implementation-defined type that holds a reference to auto_ptr. 
[std::auto_ptr](../auto_ptr) is implicitly convertible to and from this type. The implementation is allowed to provide the template with a different 
name or implement equivalent functionality in other ways.

### Parameters
`r`	-	another auto_ptr to transfer the ownership of the object from
`m`	-	an object of implementation-defined type that holds a reference to auto_ptr

### Return value

`*this`.

### Notes
The constructor and the copy assignment operator from auto_ptr_ref is provided to allow copy-constructing and assigning [std::auto_ptr](../auto_ptr) from nameless temporaries. 
Since its copy constructor and copy assignment operator take the argument as non-const reference, they cannot bind rvalue arguments directly. 
However, a user-defined conversion can be executed (which releases the original auto_ptr), followed by a call to the constructor or copy-assignment operator that 
take auto_ptr_ref by value. This is an early implementation of move semantics.
