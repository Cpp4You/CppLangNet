If multiple threads of execution access the same `std::shared_ptr` object without synchronization and any of those accesses uses a non-const member function
of `shared_ptr` then a data race will occur unless all such access is performed through these functions, which are overloads of the corresponding atomic access functions 
(`std::atomic_load`, `std::atomic_store`, etc.)

Note that the control block of a `shared_ptr` is thread-safe: different `std::shared_ptr` objects can be accessed using mutable operations, such as `operator=` or `reset`,
simultaneously by multiple threads, even when these instances are copies, and share the same control block internally.

1) <br/>
Determines whether atomic access to the shared pointer pointed-to by `p` is lock-free.

2) <br/>
Equivalent to `atomic_load_explicit(p, std::memory_order_seq_cst)`

3) <br/>
Returns the shared pointer pointed-to by `p`. As with the non-specialized `std::atomic_load_explicit`, `mo` cannot be `std::memory_order_release` or `std::memory_order_acq_rel`

4) <br/>
Equivalent to `atomic_store_explicit(p, r, memory_order_seq_cst)`

5) <br/>
Stores the shared pointer `r` in the shared pointer pointed-to by `p` atomically, effectively executing `p->swap(r)`.
As with the non-specialized `std::atomic_store_explicit`, `mo` cannot be `std::memory_order_acquire` or `std::memory_order_acq_rel`.

6) <br/>
Equivalent to `atomic_exchange_explicit(p, r, memory_order_seq_cst)`

7) <br/>
Stores the shared pointer `r` in the shared pointer pointed to by `p` and returns the value formerly pointed-to by `p`, atomically. Effectively executes `p->swap(r)` 
and returns a copy of `r` after the swap.

8) <br/>
Equivalent to `atomic_compare_exchange_weak_explicit(p, expected, desired, std::memory_order_seq_cst, std::memory_order_seq_cst)`

9) <br/>
Equivalent to `atomic_compare_exchange_strong_explicit(p, expected, desired, std::memory_order_seq_cst, std::memory_order_seq_cst)`

10) <br/>
Compares the shared pointers pointed-to by `p` and expected. If they are equivalent 
(store the same pointer value, and either share ownership of the same object or are both empty), 
assigns desired into `*p` using the memory ordering constraints specified by `success` and returns `true`. 
If they are not equivalent, assigns `*p` into `*expected` using the memory ordering constraints specified by `failure` and returns `false`.

11) <br/>
Same as 10), but may fail spuriously.

All these functions invoke undefined behavior if `p` is a `null pointer`.

### Parameters
`p`, `expected`	-	a pointer to a `std::shared_ptr`
`r`, `desired`	-	a `std::shared_ptr`
`mo`, `success`, `failure`	-	memory ordering selectors of type `std::memory_order`

### Exceptions
These functions do not throw exceptions.

### Return value
1) `true` if atomic access is implemented using lock-free instructions
2,3) A copy of the pointed-to shared pointer.
4,5) (none)
6,7) A copy of the formerly pointed-to shared pointer
8,9,10,11) `true` if the shared pointers were equivalent and the exchange was performed, `false` otherwise.

### Notes
These functions are typically implemented using mutexes, stored in a global hash table where the pointer value is used as the key.

To avoid data races, once a shared pointer is passed to any of these functions, it cannot be accessed non-atomically. 
In particular, you cannot dereference such a `shared_ptr` without first atomically loading it into another `shared_ptr` object, and then dereferencing through the second object.

The Concurrency TS offers atomic smart pointer classes `atomic_shared_ptr` and `atomic_weak_ptr` as a replacement for the use of these functions.


*These functions were deprecated in favor of the specializations of the `std::atomic template`: `std::atomic<std::shared_ptr>` and `std::atomic<std::weak_ptr>`.(since C++20)*
