# std::get_deleter

Defined in header `<memory>`.

### Declarations


```cpp title="C++11"
template< class Deleter, class T >
Deleter* get_deleter( const std::shared_ptr<T>& p ) noexcept;
```

Access to the `p`'s deleter. If the shared pointer `p` owns a deleter of type cv-unqualified Deleter 
(e.g. if it was created with one of the constructors that take a deleter as a parameter), then returns a pointer to the deleter. Otherwise, returns a `null` pointer.

### Parameters

`p` - a shared pointer whose deleter needs to be accessed

### Return value

A pointer to the owned deleter or `nullptr`. The returned pointer is valid at least as long as there remains at least one `shared_ptr` instance that owns it.

### Notes
The returned pointer may outlive the last `shared_ptr` if, for example, `std::weak_ptrs` remain and the implementation doesn't destroy the 
deleter until the entire control block is destroyed.

### Example
demonstrates that `std::shared_ptr` deleter is independent of the `shared_ptr`'s type

int main()
{
    std::shared_ptr<int> aptr;
 
    {
        // create a shared_ptr that owns a Foo and a deleter
        auto foo_p = new Foo;
        std::shared_ptr<Foo> r(foo_p, foo_deleter);
        aptr = std::shared_ptr<int>(r, &r->i); // aliasing ctor
        // aptr is now pointing to an int, but managing the whole Foo
    } // r gets destroyed (deleter not called)
 
    // obtain pointer to the deleter:
    if(auto del_p = std::get_deleter<void(*)(Foo*)>(aptr))
    {
        std::cout 
            << "shared_ptr<int> owns a deleter\n";
        if(*del_p == foo_deleter)
            std::cout 
                << "...and it equals &foo_deleter\n";
    } else
        std::cout 
            << "The deleter of shared_ptr<int> is null!\n";
} // deleter called here
