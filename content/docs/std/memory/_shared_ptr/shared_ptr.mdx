Constructs new `shared_ptr` from a variety of pointer types that refer to an object to manage.

---

For the purposes of the description below, a pointer type `Y*` is said to be compatible with a pointer type `T*` if either `Y*` is convertible to `T*` or
`Y` is the array type `U[N]` and `T` is `U cv []` (where `cv` is some set of cv-qualifiers).

---

1-2) <br/>
Constructs a `shared_ptr` with no managed object, i.e. empty `shared_ptr` <br/>
3-7) <br/>
Constructs a `shared_ptr` with `ptr` as the pointer to the managed object <br/>

    * For (3-4,6), `Y*` must be convertible to `T*` (Until C++17).
    
    * If T is an array type `U[N]`, (3-4,6) do not participate in overload resolution if `Y(*)[N]` is not convertible to `T*`. If `T` is an array type `U[]`, (3-4,6) 
    do not participate in overload resolution if `Y(*)[]` is not convertible to `T*`. Otherwise, (3-4,6) do not participate in overload resolution if 
    `Y*` is not convertible to `T*` (Since C++17).

        ---

      Additionally:
        * 3) Uses the delete-expression delete `ptr` if `T` is not an array type; `delete[] ptr` if `T` is an array type (since C++17) as the deleter. 
        `Y` must be a complete type. The delete expression must be well-formed, have well-defined behavior and not throw any exceptions. 
        This constructor additionally does not participate in overload resolution if the delete expression is not well-formed (since C++17).

        * 4-5) Uses the specified deleter `d` as the deleter. The expression `d(ptr)` must be well formed, have well-defined behavior and not throw any exceptions. 
        The construction of `d` and of the stored deleter copied from it must not throw exceptions.

            * Deleter must be `CopyConstructible` (until C++17).

            * These constructors additionally do not participate in overload resolution if the expression `d(ptr)` is not well-formed, 
            or if `std::is_move_constructible<D>::value` is `false` (since C++17).

        * 6-7) Same as (4-5), but additionally uses a copy of `alloc` for allocation of data for internal use. `Alloc` must be an `Allocator`.


    ---

8) <br/>
The aliasing constructor: constructs a `shared_ptr` which shares ownership information with the initial value of `r`, 
but holds an unrelated and unmanaged pointer `ptr`. If this `shared_ptr` is the last of the group to go out of scope, it will call the stored deleter 
for the object originally managed by `r`. However, calling `get()` on this `shared_ptr` will always return a copy of `ptr`. 
It is the responsibility of the programmer to make sure that this `ptr` remains valid as long as this `shared_ptr` exists, 
such as in the typical use cases where `ptr` is a member of the object managed by `r` or is an alias (e.g., downcast) of `r.get()` 
For the second overload taking an `rvalue`, `r` is empty and `r.get() == nullptr` after the call (since C++20). <br/>

9) <br/>
Constructs a `shared_ptr` which shares ownership of the object managed by `r`. If `r` manages no object, `*this` manages no object either. 
The template overload doesn't participate in overload resolution if `Y*` is not implicitly *convertible to (until C++17)* / *compatible with (since C++17)* `T*`. <br/>

10) <br/>
Move-constructs a `shared_ptr` from `r`. After the construction, `*this` contains a copy of the previous state of `r`, `r` is empty and its stored pointer is `null`. 
The template overload doesn't participate in overload resolution if `Y*` is not implicitly *convertible to (until C++17)* / *compatible with (since C++17)* `T*`. <br/>

11) <br/>
Constructs a `shared_ptr` which shares ownership of the object managed by `r`. `Y*` must be implicitly convertible to `T*` (until C++17).
This overload participates in overload resolution only if `Y*` is compatible with `T*` (since C++17). Note that `r.lock()` may be used for the same purpose: 
the difference is that this constructor throws an exception if the argument is empty, while `std::weak_ptr<T>::lock()` constructs an empty `std::shared_ptr` in that case. <br/>

12) <br/>
Constructs a `shared_ptr` that stores and owns the object formerly owned by `r`. `Y*` must be convertible to `T*`. After construction, `r` is empty. <br/>

13) <br/>
Constructs a `shared_ptr` which manages the object currently managed by `r`. The deleter associated with `r` is stored for future deletion of the managed object.
`r` manages no object after the call.

* This overload doesn't participate in overload resolution if `std::unique_ptr<Y, Deleter>::pointer` is not compatible with `T*`. If `r.get()` is a `null` pointer, 
this overload is equivalent to the default constructor (1)	(since C++17).


If `Deleter` is a reference type, it is equivalent to `shared_ptr(r.release()`, `std::ref(r.get_deleter())`. 
Otherwise, it is equivalent to `shared_ptr(r.release(), std::move(r.get_deleter()))`


When `T` is not an array type, the overloads (3), (4), and (6) enable `shared_from_this` with `ptr`, and the overload (13) enables 
`shared_from_this` with the pointer returned by `r.release()`.

### Parameters
`ptr` - a pointer to an object to manage
`d` - a deleter to use to destroy the object
`alloc` - an allocator to use for allocations of data for internal use
`r` - another smart pointer to share the ownership to or acquire the ownership from

### Exceptions

3) <br/>
`std::bad_alloc` if required additional memory could not be obtained. 
May throw implementation-defined exception for other errors. If an exception occurs, this calls `delete ptr` <br/>
*-if T is not an array type, and calls `delete[] ptr` otherwise (since C++17)*. <br/>
4-7) <br/>
`std::bad_alloc` if required additional memory could not be obtained. 
May throw implementation-defined exception for other errors. `d(ptr)` is called if an exception occurs. <br/>
11) <br/>
`std::bad_weak_ptr` if `r.expired() == true`. The constructor has no effect in this case. <br/>
12) <br/>
`std::bad_alloc` if required additional memory could not be obtained. May throw implementation-defined exception for other errors. 
This constructor has no effect if an exception occurs. <br/>
13) <br/>
If an exception is thrown, the constructor has no effects. <br/>


### Notes

A constructor enables `shared_from_this` with a pointer `ptr` of type `U*` means that it determines if `U` has an *unambiguous and accessible (since C++17) *
base class that is a specialization of `std::enable_shared_from_this`, and if so, the constructor evaluates the statement:

```cpp
if (ptr != nullptr && ptr->weak_this.expired())
    ptr->weak_this = std::shared_ptr<std::remove_cv_t<U>>(
                         *this, const_cast<std::remove_cv_t<U>*>(ptr));
```

Where `weak_this` is the hidden mutable `std::weak_ptr` member of `std::enable_shared_from_this`. 
The assignment to the `weak_this` member is not atomic and conflicts with any potentially concurrent access to the same object. 
This ensures that future calls to `shared_from_this()` would share ownership with the `std::shared_ptr` created by this raw pointer constructor.

The test `ptr->weak_this.expired()` in the exposition code above makes sure that `weak_this` is not reassigned if it already indicates an owner. 
*This test is required as of C++17*.

The raw pointer overloads assume ownership of the pointed-to object. Therefore, constructing a `shared_ptr` using the raw pointer overload for an object that is 
already managed by a `shared_ptr`, such as by `shared_ptr(ptr.get())` is likely to lead to undefined behavior, 
even if the object is of a type derived from `std::enable_shared_from_this`.

Because the default constructor is *constexpr*, *static* `shared_ptrs` are initialized as part of static non-local initialization, 
before any dynamic non-local initialization begins. This makes it safe to use a `shared_ptr` in a constructor of any static object.

In C++11 and C++14 it is valid to construct a `std::shared_ptr<T>` from a `std::unique_ptr<T[]>`:

```cpp
std::unique_ptr<int[]> arr(new int[1]);
std::shared_ptr<int> ptr(std::move(arr));
```

Since the `shared_ptr` obtains its deleter (a `std::default_delete<T[]>` object) from the `std::unique_ptr`, the array will be correctly deallocated.

This is no longer allowed in C++17. Instead the array form `std::shared_ptr<T[]>` should be used.
