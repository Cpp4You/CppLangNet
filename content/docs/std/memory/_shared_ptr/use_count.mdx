# std::shared_ptr&lt;T>::use_count

### Declarations
```cpp
long use_count() const noexcept;
```

Returns the number of different `shared_ptr` instances (this included) managing the current object. If there is no managed object, `​0`​ is returned.

In multithreaded environment, the value returned by `use_count` is approximate (typical implementations use a `memory_order_relaxed` load)

### Parameters
(none)

### Return value
the number of `std::shared_ptr` instances managing the current object or `​0​` if there is no managed object.

### Notes
Common use cases include

* comparison with ​`0`​. If `use_count` returns `zero`, the shared pointer is empty and manages no objects (whether or not its stored pointer is `nullptr`).
* comparison with `1`. If `use_count` returns `1`, there are no other owners. The deprecated (since C++17) member function `unique()` is provided for this use case (until C++20). 
In multithreaded environment, this does not imply that the object is safe to modify because accesses to the managed object by former shared owners may not have completed, 
and because new shared owners may be introduced concurrently, such as by `std::weak_ptr::lock`.

### Example

<Columns spacing = "20px" columns = {['6fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp
#include <memory>
#include <iostream>
 
void fun(std::shared_ptr<int> sp)
{
    std::cout 
        << "in fun(): sp.use_count() == " 
        << sp.use_count()
        << " (object @ " << sp << ")\n";
}
 
int main()
{
    auto sp1 = std::make_shared<int>(5);
    std::cout 
        << "in main(): sp1.use_count() == " 
        << sp1.use_count()
        << " (object @ " << sp1 << ")\n";
 
    fun(sp1);
}
```

</div>
<div>

```plaintext title="Possible Result"
in main(): sp1.use_count() == 1 (object @ 0x20eec30)
in fun(): sp.use_count() == 2 (object @ 0x20eec30)
```

</div>
</Columns>
