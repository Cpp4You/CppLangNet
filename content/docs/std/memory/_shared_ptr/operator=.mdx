# std::shared_ptr&lt;T>::operator=

### Declarations

```cpp
// 1)
shared_ptr& operator=( const shared_ptr& r ) noexcept;

template< class Y >
shared_ptr& operator=( const shared_ptr<Y>& r ) noexcept;
// 2)
shared_ptr& operator=( shared_ptr&& r ) noexcept;

template< class Y >
shared_ptr& operator=( shared_ptr<Y>&& r ) noexcept;
// 3)
template< class Y >
shared_ptr& operator=( std::auto_ptr<Y>&& r ); // deprecated in C++11, removed in C++17
// 4)
template< class Y, class Deleter >
shared_ptr& operator=( std::unique_ptr<Y,Deleter>&& r );
```

Replaces the managed object with the one managed by r.

If `*this` already owns an object and it is the last shared_ptr owning it, and r is not the same as `*this`, the object is destroyed through the owned deleter.

1) <br/>
Shares ownership of the object managed by r. If r manages no object, `*this` manages no object too. Equivalent to `shared_ptr<T>(r).swap(*this)`. <br/>
2) <br/>
Move-assigns a shared_ptr from r. After the assignment, `*this` contains a copy of the previous state of r, and r is empty. 
Equivalent to `shared_ptr<T>(std::move(r)).swap(*this)`. <br/>
3) <br/>
Transfers the ownership of the object managed by r to `*this`. If r manages no object, `*this` manages no object too. After the assignment, 
`*this` contains the pointer previously held by r, and use_count()==1; also r is empty. Equivalent to `shared_ptr<T>(r).swap(*this)`. <br/>
4) <br/>
Transfers the ownership of the object managed by r to `*this`. The deleter associated to r is stored for future deletion of the managed object. 
r manages no object after the call. Equivalent to `shared_ptr<T>(std::move(r)).swap(*this)`. <br/>

### Parameters
`r` - another smart pointer to share the ownership to or acquire the ownership from
### Return value

`*this`

### Notes
The implementation may meet the requirements without creating a temporary `shared_ptr` object.

### Exceptions

3-4) May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
