# std::allocate_shared, std::allocate_shared_for_overwrite

Defined in header `<memory>`.

### Declarations

<VersionTabs content ={{
    "T is U[]" : <IsU />,
    "T is not U[]" : <IsNotU />,
    "T is non-array" : <IsNonArray />,
}}/>

1) <br/>
Constructs an object of type `T` and wraps it in a `std::shared_ptr` using `args` as the parameter list for the constructor of `T`. 
The object is constructed as if by the expression: 
* `::new (pv) T(v)` (until C++20)
* `std::allocator_traits<A2>::construct(a, pv, v)` (since C++20), 

where `pv` is an internal `void*` pointer to storage suitable to hold an object of type `T` and a is a copy of the allocator rebound to `std::remove_cv_t<T>`.
The storage is typically larger than `sizeof(T)` in order to use one allocation for both the control block of the shared pointer and the `T` object. 
The `std::shared_ptr` constructor called by this function enables `shared_from_this` with a pointer to the newly constructed object of type `T`. <br/>

All memory allocation is done using a copy of `alloc`, which must satisfy the `Allocator` requirements. <br/>
This overload participates in overload resolution only if `T` is *not* an array type.<br/>

2,3) <br/>
Same as (1), but the object constructed is a possibly-multidimensional array whose every non-array element is initialized as if by the expression `std::allocator_traits<A2>::construct(a2, pv)` 
where `a2` of type `A2` is the copy of the allocator rebound to manage objects of type `std::remove_cv_t<std::remove_all_extents_t<T>>`. 

The overload (2) creates an array of size `N` along its first dimension. The array elements are initialized in ascending order of their addresses, 
and when their lifetime ends are destroyed in the reverse order of their original construction.

4,5) <br/>
Same as (2,3), but the elements of the array are initialized from the default value `u`. If `std::remove_extent_t<T>` is not itself an array type, 
then this is performed as if by the same allocator expression as in (1), except that the allocator is rebound to the `std::remove_cv_t<std::remove_all_extents_t<T>>`. 

Otherwise, this is performed as if by initializing every non-array element of the (possibly multidimensional) array with the corresponding element from `u` using the same allocator 
expression as in (1), except that the allocator is rebound to the type `std::remove_cv_t<std::remove_all_extents_t<T>>`. 

The overload (4) creates an array of size `N` along the first dimension. The array elements are initialized in ascending order of their addresses, 
and when their lifetime ends are destroyed in the reverse order of their original construction.

6) <br/>
Same as (1) if `T` is not an array type and (3) if `T` is `U[N]`, except that the created object is default-initialized.

7) <br/> 
Same as (2), except that the individual array elements are default-initialized.

For `allocate_shared`, the object *(or the individual array elements for (2-5)) (since C++20)* are destroyed via the expression `std::allocator_traits<A2>::destroy(a, p)`,
where `p` is a pointer to the object and a is a copy of the allocator passed to `allocate_shared`, rebound to the type of the object being destroyed.


*For `allocate_shared_for_overwrite`, the object (or individual elements if `T` is an array type) will be destroyed by `p->~X()`, where `p` 
is a pointer to the object and `X` is its type. (since C++20)*


### Parameters

`alloc`	-	The `Allocator` to use. <br/>
`args..`.	-	list of arguments with which an instance of `T` will be constructed.<br/>
`N`	-	array size to use<br/>
`u`	-	the initial value to initialize every element of the array<br/>

### Return value

`std::shared_ptr` of an instance of type `T`.

### Exceptions

Can throw the exceptions thrown from `Alloc::allocate()` or from the constructor of `T`. 
If an exception is thrown, (1) has no effect. 

*If an exception is thrown during the construction of the array, already-initialized elements are destroyed in reverse order (since C++20)*

### Notes

Like `std::make_shared`, this function typically performs only one allocation, and places both the `T` object and the control block in the allocated memory block 
(the standard recommends but does not require this, all known implementations do this). A copy of `alloc` is stored as part of the control block so that it can be used to 
deallocate it once both shared and weak reference counts reach zero.

Unlike the `std::shared_ptr` constructors, `std::allocate_shared` does not accept a separate custom deleter: the supplied allocator is used for destruction of the control block 
and the `T` object, and for deallocation of their shared memory block.


*`std::shared_ptr` supports array types (as of C++17), but `std::allocate_shared` does not. This functionality is supported by `boost::allocate_shared`. (Until C++20)*

A constructor enables `shared_from_this` with a pointer ptr of type `U*` means that it determines if `U` has an *(unambiguous and accessible (since C++17))* base 
class that is a specialization of `std::enable_shared_from_this`, and if so, the constructor evaluates the statement:

```cpp
if (ptr != nullptr && ptr->weak_this.expired())
    ptr->weak_this = std::shared_ptr<std::remove_cv_t<U>>(
                         *this, const_cast<std::remove_cv_t<U>*>(ptr));
```

Where `weak_this` is the hidden mutable `std::weak_ptr` member of `std::enable_shared_from_this`. 
The assignment to the `weak_this` member is not atomic and conflicts with any potentially concurrent access to the same object. 
This ensures that future calls to `shared_from_this()` would share ownership with the `std::shared_ptr` created by this raw pointer constructor.

The test `ptr->weak_this.expired()` in the exposition code above makes sure that `weak_this` is not reassigned if it already indicates an owner. This test is required as of C++17.
