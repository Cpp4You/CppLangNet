# std::weak_ptr&lt;T>::lock

`Since C++11`
```cpp
std::shared_ptr<T> lock() const noexcept;
```

Creates a new [std::shared_ptr](../shared_ptr) that shares ownership of the managed object. If there is no managed object, i.e. `*this` is empty, 
then the returned shared_ptr also is empty.

Effectively returns `expired() ? shared_ptr<T>() : shared_ptr<T>(*this)`, executed atomically.

### Parameters

(none)

### Return value

A shared_ptr which shares ownership of the owned object if std::weak_ptr::expired returns `false`. Else returns default-constructed shared_ptr of type `T`.

### Notes 

Both this function and the constructor of std::shared_ptr may be used to acquire temporary ownership of the managed object referred to by a std::weak_ptr. 
The difference is that the constructor of std::shared_ptr throws an exception when its std::weak_ptr argument is empty, while `std::weak_ptr<T>::lock()`
constructs an empty `std::shared_ptr<T>`.

### Example

<Columns spacing = "20px" columns={['6fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
 
void observe(std::weak_ptr<int> weak) 
{
    if (auto observe = weak.lock()) {
        std::cout 
            << "\tobserve() able to lock weak_ptr<>, value=" 
            << *observe << "\n";
    } else {
        std::cout 
            << "\tobserve() unable to lock weak_ptr<>\n";
    }
}
 
int main()
{
    std::weak_ptr<int> weak;
    std::cout 
        << "weak_ptr<> not yet initialized\n";
    observe(weak);
 
    {
        auto shared = std::make_shared<int>(42);
        weak = shared;
        std::cout 
            << "weak_ptr<> initialized with shared_ptr.\n";
        observe(weak);
    }
 
    std::cout 
        << "shared_ptr<> has been destructed due to scope exit.\n";
    observe(weak);
}
```

</div>

<div>

```plaintext title="Result"
weak_ptr<> not yet initialized
        observe() unable to lock weak_ptr<>
weak_ptr<> initialized with shared_ptr.
        observe() able to lock weak_ptr<>, value=42
shared_ptr<> has been destructed due to scope exit.
        observe() unable to lock weak_ptr<>
```
