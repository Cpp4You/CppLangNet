# std::weak_ptr&lt;T>::expired

```cpp title="Since C++11"
bool expired() const noexcept;
```

Equivalent to `use_count() == 0`. The destructor for the managed object may not yet have been called, 
but this object's destruction is imminent (or may have already happened).

### Parameters

(none))

### Return value

`true` if the managed object has already been deleted, `false` otherwise.

### Notes

This function is inherently racy if the managed object is shared among threads. In particular, 
a false result may become stale before it can be used. A true result is reliable.


### Example

Demonstrates how expired is used to check validity of the pointer.

<Columns spacing = "20px" columns={['6fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
 
std::weak_ptr<int> gw;
 
void f()
{
    if (!gw.expired()) {
	std::cout << "gw is valid\n";
    }
    else {
        std::cout << "gw is expired\n";
    }
}
 
int main()
{
    {
        auto sp = std::make_shared<int>(42);
	gw = sp;
 
	f();
    }
 
    f();
}
```

</div>

<div>

```plaintext title="Result"
gw is valid
gw is expired
```
