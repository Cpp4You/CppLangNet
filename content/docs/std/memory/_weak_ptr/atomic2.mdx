# std::atomic(std::weak_ptr)

```cpp title="Since C++20"
template <class T> struct std::atomic<std::weak_ptr<T>>;
```
The partial template specialization of [std::atomic](/docs/std/atomic/atomic) for std::weak_ptr&lt;T> allows users to manipulate 
[weak_ptr](../weak_ptr) objects atomically.

If multiple threads of execution access the same std::weak_ptr object without synchronization and any of those accesses uses a non-const member function of 
weak_ptr then a data race will occur unless all such access is performed through an instance of std::atomic&lt;std::weak_ptr>.

Associated use_count increments are guaranteed to be part of the atomic operation. Associated use_count decrements are sequenced after the atomic operation, 
but are not required to be part of it, except for the use_count change when overriding expected in a failed CAS. 
Any associated deletion and deallocation are sequenced after the atomic update step and are not part of the atomic operation.

Note that the control block used by [std::weak_ptr](../weak_ptr)  and [std::shared_ptr](../shared_ptr) is thread-safe: different non-atomic [std::weak_ptr](../weak_ptr) 
objects can be accessed using mutable operations, 
such as operator= or reset, simultaneously by multiple threads, even when these instances are copies or otherwise share the same control block internally.

The type T may be an incomplete type.

### Member types

<SymbolTable noTraits>
	<Symbol

### Member functions

All non-specialized [std::atomic](/docs/std/atomic/atomic) functions are also provided by this specialization, and no additional member functions.

---

atomic&lt;weak_ptr&lt;T>>::**atomic**
```cpp
constexpr atomic() noexcept = default;          (1)	
atomic(std::weak_ptr<T> desired) noexcept;      (2)	
atomic(const atomic&) = delete;                 (3)
```
1) Initializes the underlying weak_ptr&lt;T> to default-constructed value.
2) Initializes the underlying weak_ptr&lt;T> to a copy of desired. As with any [std::atomic](/docs/std/atomic/atomic) type, initialization is not an atomic operation.
3) Atomic types are not copy/move constructible.

---

atomic&lt;weak_ptr&lt;T>>::**operator=**
```cpp
void operator=(const atomic&) = delete;               (1)	
void operator=(std::weak_ptr<T> desired) noexcept;    (2)
```
1) Atomic types are not copy/move assignable.
2) Value assignment, equivalent to `store(desired)`.

---

atomic&lt;weak_ptr&lt;T>>::**is_lock_free**
```cpp
bool is_lock_free() const noexcept;
```
Returns true if the atomic operations on all objects of this type are lock-free, false otherwise.

---

atomic&lt;weak_ptr&lt;T>>::**store**
```cpp
void store(std::weak_ptr<T> desired,
           std::memory_order order = std::memory_order_seq_cst) noexcept;
```
Atomically replaces the value of `*this` with the value of desired as if by `p.swap(desired)` where `p` is the underlying `std::weak_ptr<T>`.
Memory is ordered according to order. The behavior is undefined if order is std::memory_order_consume, std::memory_order_acquire, or std::memory_order_acq_rel.

---

atomic&lt;weak_ptr&lt;T>>::**load**
```cpp
std::weak_ptr<T> load(std::memory_order order = std::memory_order_seq_cst) const noexcept;
```
Atomically returns a copy of the underlying `std::weak_ptr<T>`. Memory is ordered according to order. 
The behavior is undefined if order is std::memory_order_release or std::memory_order_acq_rel.

---

atomic&lt;weak_ptr&lt;T>>::**operator std::weak_ptr&lt;T>**
```cpp
operator std::weak_ptr<T>() const noexcept;
```
Equivalent to `return load()`;

---

atomic&lt;weak_ptr&lt;T>>::**exchange**
```cpp
std::weak_ptr<T> exchange(std::weak_ptr<T> desired,
                          std::memory_order order = std::memory_order_seq_cst) noexcept;
```
Atomically replaces the underlying `std::weak_ptr<T>` with desired as if by `p.swap(desired)` where `p` is the underlying `std::weak_ptr<T>`,
and returns a copy of the value that `p` had immediately before the swap. Memory is ordered according to order. This is an atomic read-modify-write operation.

---

atomic&lt;weak_ptr&lt;T>>::**compare_exchange_weak, compare_exchange_strong**
```cpp
bool compare_exchange_strong(std::weak_ptr<T>& expected, std::weak_ptr<T> desired,
                             std::memory_order success, std::memory_order failure) noexcept;    (1)	
bool compare_exchange_weak(std::weak_ptr<T>& expected, std::weak_ptr<T> desired,
                           std::memory_order success, std::memory_order failure) noexcept;      (2)	
bool compare_exchange_strong(std::weak_ptr<T>& expected, std::weak_ptr<T> desired,
                             std::memory_order order = std::memory_order_seq_cst) noexcept;     (3)	
bool compare_exchange_weak(std::weak_ptr<T>& expected, std::weak_ptr<T> desired,
                           std::memory_order order = std::memory_order_seq_cst) noexcept;       (4)
```
1) If the underlying `std::weak_ptr<T>` stores the same pointer value as expected and shares ownership with it, or if both underlying and expected are empty, 
assigns from desired to the underlying `std::weak_ptr<T>`, returns true, and orders memory according to success, otherwise assigns from the underlying `std::weak_ptr<T>` to expected, 
returns false, and orders memory according to failure. The behavior is undefined if failure is std::memory_order_release or std::memory_order_acq_rel. On success, 
the operation is an atomic read-modify-write operation on `*this` and expected is not accessed after the atomic update. On failure, the operation is an atomic load operation on
`*this` and expected is updated with the existing value read from the atomic object. This update to expected's use_count is part of this atomic operation, 
although the write itself (and any subsequent deallocation/destruction) is not required to be.

2) Same as (1), but may also fail spuriously.

3) Equivalent to: `return compare_exchange_strong(expected, desired, order, fail_order);`, 
where fail_order is the same as order except that std::memory_order_acq_rel is replaced by std::memory_order_acquire and std::memory_order_release is replaced by
std::memory_order_relaxed.

4) Equivalent to: `return compare_exchange_weak(expected, desired, order, fail_order);`, 
where fail_order is the same as order except that std::memory_order_acq_rel is replaced by std::memory_order_acquire and std::memory_order_release is replaced 
by std::memory_order_relaxed.

---

atomic&lt;weak_ptr&lt;T>>::**wait**
```cpp
void wait(std::weak_ptr<T> old
          std::memory_order order = std::memory_order_seq_cst) const noexcept;
```
Performs an atomic waiting operation.

Compares `load(order)` with old and if they are equivalent then blocks until `*thi`s is notified by notify_one() or notify_all(). 
This is repeated until `load(order)` changes. This function is guaranteed to return only if value has changed, even if underlying implementation unblocks spuriously.

Memory is ordered according to order. The behavior is undefined if order is std::memory_order_release or std::memory_order_acq_rel.

Notes: two [std::weak_ptrs](../weak_ptr) are equivalent if they store the same pointer and either share ownership or are both empty.

---

atomic&lt;weak_ptr&lt;T>>::**notify_one**
```cpp
void notify_one() noexcept;
```
Performs an atomic notifying operation.

If there is a thread blocked in atomic waiting operations (i.e. `wait()`) on `*this`, then unblocks at least one such thread; otherwise does nothing.

---


atomic&lt;weak_ptr&lt;T>>::**notify_all**
```cpp
void notify_all() noexcept;
```
Performs an atomic notifying operation.

Unblocks all threads blocked in atomic waiting operations (i.e. `wait()`) on `*this`, if there are any; otherwise does nothing.

---

### Member constants
The only standard [std::atomic](/docs/std/atomic/atomic) member constant is_always_lock_free is also provided by this specialization.

---


atomic&lt;weak_ptr&lt;T>>::**is_always_lock_free**
```cpp
static constexpr bool is_always_lock_free = /*implementation-defined*/;
```
Performs an atomic notifying operation.

Unblocks all threads blocked in atomic waiting operations (i.e. `wait()`) on `*this`, if there are any; otherwise does nothing.
