# std::owner_less

Defined in header `<memory>`.

`Since C++17`
```cpp
template<>
struct owner_less<void>;
```

`std::owner_less<>` is a specialization of [std::owner_less](./owner_less) with parameter types deduced.

### Member types

|Member type |	Definition|
|:--:|:--:|
|is_transparent	| `/* unspecified */` |

### Notes
The member type is_transparent indicates to the caller that this function object is a *transparent* function object: 
it accepts arguments of arbitrary types and uses perfect forwarding, which avoids unnecessary copying and conversion when the function object is used in heterogeneous context, 
or with rvalue arguments. In particular, template functions such as `std::set::find` and `std::set::lower_bound` make use of this member type on their Compare types.

std::owner_less&lt;void>::**operator()**

```cpp
template<class T, class U>
bool operator()( const std::shared_ptr<T>& lhs,
                 const std::shared_ptr<U>& rhs ) const noexcept;    // (since C++11)
```
```cpp
template<class T, class U>
bool operator()( const std::shared_ptr<T>& lhs,
                 const std::weak_ptr<U>& rhs ) const noexcept;      // (since C++11)
```
```cpp
template<class T, class U>
bool operator()( const std::weak_ptr<T>& lhs,
                 const std::shared_ptr<U>& rhs ) const noexcept;    // (since C++11)
```
```cpp
template<class T, class U>
bool operator()( const std::weak_ptr<T>& lhs,
                 const std::weak_ptr<U>& rhs ) const noexcept;      // (since C++11)
```

Compares `lhs` and `rhs` using owner-based semantics. Effectively calls `lhs.owner_before(rhs)`.

The ordering is strict weak ordering relation.

`lhs` and `rhs` are equivalent only if they are both empty or share ownership.

#### Parameters
`lhs`, `rhs`	-	shared-ownership pointers to compare
#### Return value
`true` if `lhs` is less than `rhs` as determined by the owner-based ordering.
