# <Since v='cpp11'><small>C++ named requirements:</small> *TrivialType*</Since>

Specifies that a type is a trivial type.

Note: the standard doesn't define a named requirement with this name. This is a type category defined by the core language. 
It is included here as a named requirement only for consistency.

### Requirements
The following types are collectively called *trivial types*:

* [scalar types](/docs/std/named_req/ScalarType)
* [trivial class types](/docs/std/language/classes#Trivial_class)
* arrays of such types
* cv-qualified versions of these types
