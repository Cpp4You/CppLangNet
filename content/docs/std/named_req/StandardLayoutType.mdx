# <Since v='cpp11'><small>C++ named requirements:</small> *StandardLayoutType*</Since>
Specifies that a type is a standard layout type. Standard layout types are useful for communicating with code written in other programming languages.

Note: the standard doesn't define a named requirement with this name. This is a type category defined by the core language. 
It is included here as a named requirement only for consistency.

### Requirements
The following types are collectively called *standard-layout types*:

* [scalar types](/docs/std/named_req/ScalarType)
* [standard-layout class types](/docs/std/language/classes#Standard-layout_class)
* arrays of such types
* cv-qualified versions of these types

### Properties
See [Standard-layout](/docs/std/language/data_members#Standard-layout).

### Defect reports
The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

|    DR    | Applied to |      Behavior as published                |        Correct behavior                 |
|:--------:|:----------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------:|
| CWG 1672 | C++11 | first non-static data member rule ignored existence of empty base classes                         | first non-static data member rule made recursive  |
| CWG 1813 | C++11 | class with a member defined in an indirect base wasn't technically standard-layout                | all member declarations must be in the same class |
| CWG 2120 | C++11 | array as first member wasn't considered when comparing the first element type with type of a base | array members are considered                      |
