# Floor

Defined in header `<cmath>`.

### Description

Computes the largest integer value not greater than `num`. The library provides overloads of `std::floor` for all 
cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter `num` (since C++23).
`Additional overloads` are provided for all integer types, which are treated as `double`
(since C++11).



### Declarations

<SwitchView content ={{
    "cpp23" : <Floor_Function_Declaration_Cpp23 />,
    "cpp11" : <Floor_Function_Declaration_Cpp11 />,
}}/>


### Parameters
 
`num` - floating-point or integer value

### Return value

If no errors occur, the largest integer value not greater than `num`, that is *⌊num⌋*, is returned.

        src="/img/doc/math/floor/math-floor.svg"
    />

### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in math_errhandling.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559):

The current rounding mode has no effect. <br/>
If num is `±∞`, it is returned, unmodified<br/>
If num is `±0`, it is returned, unmodified<br/>
If num is NaN, NaN is returned<br/>

### Notes

FE_INEXACT may be (but isn't required to be) raised when rounding a non-integer finite value.

The largest representable floating-point values are exact integers in all standard floating-point formats, 
so this function never overflows on its own; 
however the result may overflow any integer type (including `std::intmax_t`), when stored in an integer variable.

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as `Additional Overloads`. 
They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument `num` of integer type, <br/>
`std::floor(num)` has the same effect as `std::floor(static_cast<double>(num))`


### Examples



<Columns spacing = "20px" columns={['6fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    std::cout 
        << std::fixed
        << "floor(+2.7) = " 
        << std::floor(+2.7) << '\n'
        << "floor(-2.7) = " 
        << std::floor(-2.7) << '\n'
        << "floor(-0.0) = " 
        << std::floor(-0.0) << '\n'
        << "floor(-Inf) = " 
        << std::floor(-INFINITY) << '\n';
}

```

</div>

<div>

```plaintext title="Result"
floor(+2.7) = 2.000000
floor(-2.7) = -3.000000
floor(-0.0) = -0.000000
floor(-Inf) = -inf
```

</div>
</Columns>
