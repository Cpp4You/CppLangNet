# Log1p

Defined in header `<cmath>`.

### Description

Computes the natural (base `e`) logarithm of `1 + num`. This function is more precise than the expression `std::log(1 + num)` if `num` is close to zero.
`Additional overloads` are provided for all integer types, which are treated as `double`.

### Declarations

<SwitchView content ={{
    "cpp23" : <Log1p_Function_Declaration_Cpp23 />,
    "cpp11" : <Log1p_Function_Declaration_Cpp11 />,
}}/>


### Parameters
 
`num` - floating-point or integer value

### Return value

If no errors occur `ln(1+num)` is returned.

If a domain error occurs, an implementation-defined value is returned (NaN where supported).

If a pole error occurs, `-HUGE_VAL`, `-HUGE_VALF`, or `-HUGE_VALL` is returned.

If a range error occurs due to underflow, the correct result (after rounding) is returned.

### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in math_errhandling.

Domain error occurs if `num` is less than zero.

Pole error may occur if `num` is zero.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559):

If the argument is `±0`, `-∞` is returned and `FE_DIVBYZERO `is raised<br/>
If the argument is `1`, `+0` is returned<br/>
If the argument is negative, NaN is returned and `FE_INVALID` is raised<br/>
If the argument is `+∞`, `+∞` is returned<br/>
If the argument is NaN, NaN is returned<br/>

### Notes

The functions [std::expm1](/docs/std/math/mathematical_functions/expm1/) and `std::log1p` are useful for financial calculations, for example, when calculating small daily interest rates: `(1+x)n-1` 
an be expressed as `std::expm1(n * std::log1p(x))`. These functions also simplify writing accurate inverse hyperbolic functions.

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as `Additional Overloads`. They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their first argument `num1` 
and second argument `num2`:

If `num1` or `num2` has type `long double`, then  <br/>
`std::log1p(num1, num2)` has the same effect as  <br/>
`std::log1p(static_cast<long double>(num1), static_cast<long double>(num2))`.

Otherwise, if `num1` and/or `num2` has type `double` or an integer type, then  <br/>
`std::log1p(num1, num2)` has the same effect as  <br/>
`std::log1p(static_cast<double>(num1), static_cast<double>(num2))`.

Otherwise, if `num1` or `num2` has type `float`, then  <br/>
`std::log1p(num1, num2)` has the same effect as  <br/>
`std::log1p(static_cast<float>(num1), static_cast<float>(num2))`. (until C++23)

If `num1` and `num2` have arithmetic types, then  <br/>
`std::log1p(num1, num2)` has the same effect as  <br/>
`std::log1p(static_cast</* common-floating-point-type */>(num1), static_cast</* common-floating-point-type */>(num2))`.

where `/* common-floating-point-type */` is the floating-point type with the greatest floating-point conversion rank and greatest 
floating-point conversion subrank between the types of `num1` and `num2`, arguments of integer type are considered to have the same floating-point conversion rank as `double`.

If no such floating-point type with the greatest rank and subrank exists, then overload resolution does not result in a usable candidate from the overloads provided.
