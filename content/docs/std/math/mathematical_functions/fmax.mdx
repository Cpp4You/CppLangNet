# Fmax

Defined in header `<cmath>`.

### Description

 Returns the larger of two floating point arguments, treating NaNs as missing data (between a NaN and a numeric value, the numeric value is chosen). 
 The library provides overloads of `std::fmax` for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameters `x` and `y`.

### Declarations

<SwitchView content ={{
    "cpp23" : <Fmax_Function_Declaration_Cpp23 />,
    "cpp11" : <Fmax_Function_Declaration_Cpp11 />,
}}/>


### Parameters
 
`x`,`y` - floating-point or integer values

### Return value
If successful, returns the larger of two floating point values. The value returned is exact and does not depend on any rounding modes.


### Error handling
This function is not subject to any of the error conditions specified in math_errhandling.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559):

If one of the two arguments is NaN, the value of the other argument is returned
Only if both arguments are NaN, NaN is returned


### Notes
This function is not required to be sensitive to the sign of zero, although some implementations additionally enforce that if one 
argument is `+0` and the other is `-0`, then `+0` is returned.

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as `Additional Overloads`. 
They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their first argument `num1` and second argument `num2`:

If `num1` or `num2` has type `long double`, then  <br/>
`std::fmax(num1, num2)` has the same effect as <br/>
`std::fmax(static_cast<long double>(num1), static_cast<long double>(num2))`.

Otherwise, if `num1` and/or `num2` has type `double` or an integer type, then  <br/>
`std::fmax(num1, num2)` has the same effect as  <br/>
`std::fmax(static_cast<double>(num1), static_cast<double>(num2))`.

Otherwise, if `num1` or `num2` has type `float`, then  <br/>
`std::fmax(num1, num2)` has the same effect as  <br/>
`std::fmax(static_cast<float>(num1), static_cast<float>(num2))`. (until C++23)

If `num1` and `num2` have arithmetic types, then  <br/>
`std::fmax(num1, num2)` has the same effect as  <br/>
`std::fmax(static_cast</* common-floating-point-type */>(num1), static_cast</* common-floating-point-type */>(num2))`

where `/* common-floating-point-type *`/ is the floating-point type with the greatest floating-point conversion rank and 
greatest floating-point conversion subrank between the types of `num1` and `num2`, arguments of integer type are considered to have the same floating-point conversion rank as `double`.

If no such floating-point type with the greatest rank and subrank exists, then overload resolution does not result in a usable candidate from the overloads provided

        << std::fmax(2, 1) << '\n'
        << "fmax(-Inf,0) = " 
        << std::fmax(-INFINITY, 0) << '\n'
        << "fmax(NaN,-1) = " 
        << std::fmax(NAN, -1) << '\n';
