# Logb

Defined in header `<cmath>`.

### Description
Extracts the value of the unbiased radix-independent exponent from the floating-point argument `num`,  
and returns it as a floating-point value. The library provides overloads of std::logb for all 
cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter `num` (since C++23).

`Additional overloads` are provided for all integer types, which are treated as `double`.

Formally, the unbiased exponent is the signed integral part of log<sub>r</sub>|num| 
(returned by this function as a floating-point value), for non-zero `num`, where `r` 
is `std::numeric_limits<T>::radix` and `T` is the floating-point type of `num`. 
If `num` is subnormal, it is treated as though it was normalized.


### Declarations

<SwitchView content ={{
    "cpp23" : <Logb_Function_Declaration_Cpp23 />,
    "cpp11" : <Logb_Function_Declaration_Cpp11 />,
}}/>


### Parameters
 
`num` - floating-point or integer value

### Return value

If no errors occur, the unbiased exponent of `num` is returned as a signed floating-point value.

If a domain error occurs, an implementation-defined value is returned.

If a pole error occurs, `-HUGE_VAL`, `-HUGE_VALF`, or `-HUGE_VALL` is returned.

### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in math_errhandling.

Domain or range error may occur if `num` is zero.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559):

If `num` is `±0`, `-∞` is returned and FE_DIVBYZERO is raised
If `num` is `±∞`, `+∞` is returned
If `num` is NaN, NaN is returned
In all other cases, the result is exact (FE_INEXACT is never raised) and the current rounding mode is ignored

### Notes
[POSIX](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/logb.html)
requires that a pole error occurs if `num` is `±0`.

The value of the exponent returned by `std::logb` is always 1 less than the exponent returned by `std::frexp` because of the different normalization requirements: 
for the exponent `e` returned by `std::logb`, `|num*r-e|` is between 1 and `r` (typically between 1 and 2), 
but for the exponent `e` returned by st`d::fre`xp, `|num*2-e|` is between 0.5 and 1.

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as `Additional overloads`. 
They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument `num` of integer type, <br/>
`std::logb(num)` has the same effect as `std::logb(static_cast<double>(num))`.
