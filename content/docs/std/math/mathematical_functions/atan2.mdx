# Atan2

Defined in header `<cmath>`.

### Description
Computes the arc tangent of `y / x` using the signs of arguments to determine the correct quadrant.  
The library provides overloads of `std::atan2` for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameters `y` and `x` <Since v='cpp23'></Since>.
<a href='#declarations'><code><b>Additional Overloads</b></code></a> are provided for all other combinations of arithmetic types <Since v='cpp11'></Since>.


### Declarations

<SwitchView content ={{
    "cpp23" : <Atan2_Function_Declaration_Cpp23 />,
    "cpp11" : <Atan2_Function_Declaration_Cpp11 />,
}}/>


### Parameters
 
`y`, `x` - floating-point or integer values

### Return value

If no errors occur, the arc tangent of `y / x` (arctan(x/y)) in the range `[-π, +π]` radians, is returned.

	/>


If a domain error occurs, an implementation-defined value is returned (NaN where supported).

If a range error occurs due to underflow, the correct result (after rounding) is returned.

### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in math_errhandling.

Domain error may occur if `x` and `y` are both zero.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559),

If `x` and `y` are both zero, domain error does not occur <br/>
If `x` and `y` are both zero, range error does not occur either<br/>
If `y` is zero, pole error does not occur<br/>
If `y` is `±0` and `x` is negative or `-0`, `±π` is returned<br/>
If `y` is `±0` and `x` is positive or `+0`,` ±0` is returned<br/>
If `y` is `±∞` and `x` is finite, `±π/2` is returned<br/>
If `y` is `±∞` and `x` is `-∞`, `±3π/4` is returned<br/>
If `y` is `±∞` and `x` is `+∞`, `±π/4` is returned<br/>
If `x` is `±0` and `y` is negative, `-π/2` is returned<br/>
If `x` is `±0` and `y` is positive, `+π/2` is returned<br/>
If `x` is `-∞` and `y` is finite and positive, `+π` is returned<br/>
If `x` is `-∞` and `y` is finite and negative, `-π` is returned<br/>
If `x` is `+∞` and `y` is finite and positive, `+0` is returned<br/>
If `x` is `+∞` and `y` is finite and negative, `-0` is returned<br/>
If either `x` is NaN or `y` is NaN, NaN is returned<br/>

### Notes

`std::atan2(y, x)` is equivalent to 
```cpp
std::arg(std::complex<std::common_type_t<decltype(x), decltype(y)>>(x, y))
```

[POSIX](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/atan2.html)
specifies that in case of underflow, `y / x` is the value returned, and if that is not supported, an implementation-defined value no 
greater than `DBL_MIN`, `FLT_MIN`, and `LDBL_MIN` is returned.

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as <a href='#declarations'><code><b>Additional Overloads</b></code></a>. 
They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their first argument `num1` and second argument `num2`:

If `num1` or `num2` has type `long double`, then  <br/>
`std::atan2(num1, num2)` has the same effect as  <br/>
`std::atan2(static_cast<long double>(num1), static_cast<long double>(num2))`.

Otherwise, if `num1` and/or `num2` has type `double` or an integer type, then  <br/>
`std::atan2(num1, num2)` has the same effect as  <br/>
`std::atan2(static_cast<double>(num1), static_cast<double>(num2))`.

Otherwise, if `num1` or `num2` has type `float`, then  <br/>
`std::atan2(num1, num2)` has the same effect as  <br/>
`std::atan2(static_cast<float>(num1), static_cast<float>(num2))`. (until C++23)

If `num1` and `num2` have arithmetic types, then  <br/>
`std::atan2(num1, num2)` has the same effect as  <br/> <code>std::atan2(static_cast&lt;<span class='col-d'>/\* common-floating-point-type \*/</span>&gt;(num1), static_cast&lt;<span class='col-d'>/\* common-floating-point-type \*/</span>&gt;(num2))</code>.
     
where <span class='col-d'>/\* common-floating-point-type \*/</span> is the floating-point type with the greatest floating-point conversion rank and 
greatest floating-point conversion subrank between the types of `num1` and `num2`, 
arguments of integer type are considered to have the same floating-point conversion rank as `double`.

If no such floating-point type with the greatest rank and subrank exists, then overload resolution does not result in a usable candidate from the overloads provided.
