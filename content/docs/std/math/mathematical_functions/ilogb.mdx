# Ilogb

Defined in header `<cmath>`.

### Description

Extracts the value of the unbiased exponent from the floating-point argument `num`, and returns it as a signed integer value. 
The library provides overloads of `std::ilogb` for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter `num` (since C++23).

`Definitions` <br/>
4) Expands to integer constant expression whose value is either `INT_MIN` or `-INT_MAX`. <br/>
5) Expands to integer constant expression whose value is either `INT_MIN` or `+INT_MAX`. <br/>

`Additional overloads` are provided for all integer types, which are treated as `double`.

Formally, the unbiased exponent is the integral part of log<sub>r</sub>|num| as a signed integral value, for non-zero `num`, where `r` is 
`std::numeric_limits<T>::radix` and `T` is the floating-point type of `num`.

### Declarations

<SwitchView content ={{
    "cpp23" : <Ilogb_Function_Declaration_Cpp23 />,
    "cpp11" : <Ilogb_Function_Declaration_Cpp11 />,
}}/>


### Parameters
 
`num` - floating-point or integer value

### Return value

If no errors occur, the unbiased exponent of `num` is returned as a signed `int` value.

If `num` is zero, FP_ILOGB0 is returned.

If `num` is infinite, INT_MAX is returned.

If `num` is a NaN, FP_ILOGBNAN is returned.

If the correct result is greater than INT_MAX or smaller than INT_MIN, the return value is unspecified.


### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in math_errhandling.

A domain error or range error may occur if `num` is zero, infinite, or NaN. <br/>
If the correct result is greater than INT_MAX or smaller than INT_MIN, a domain error or a range error may occur.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559):

If the correct result is greater than INT_MAX or smaller than INT_MIN, FE_INVALID is raised. <br/>
If num is `±0`, `±∞`, or NaN, FE_INVALID is raised. <br/>
In all other cases, the result is exact (FE_INEXACT is never raised) and the current rounding mode is ignored. <br/>


### Notes

If `num` is not zero, infinite, or NaN, the value returned is exactly equivalent to `static_cast<int>(std::logb(num))`

[POSIX](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/ilogb.html) 
requires that a domain error occurs if `num` is zero, infinite, NaN, or if the correct result is outside of the range of `int`.

POSIX also requires that, on XSI-conformant systems, the value returned when the correct result is greater than `INT_MAX` is `INT_MAX`
 and the value returned when the correct result is less than `INT_MIN` is `INT_MIN`.

The correct result can be represented as `int` on all known implementations. <br/>
For overflow to occur, `INT_MAX` must be less than `LDBL_MAX_EXP * std::log2(FLT_RADIX)` or <br/>
`INT_MIN` must be greater than `LDBL_MIN_EXP - LDBL_MANT_DIG) * std::log2(FLT_RADIX)`.


The value of the exponent returned by `std::ilogb` is always 1 less than the exponent retuned by `std::frexp` because of the different normalization requirements: <br/>
for the exponent `e` returned by `std::ilogb`, `|num*r-e|` is between 1 and `r` (typically between 1 and 2), <br/>
but for the exponent `e` returned by `std::frexp`, `|num*2-e|` is between 0.5 and 1.

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as `Additional Overloads`. 
They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument num of integer type, 

`std::ilogb(num)` has the same effect as `std::ilogb(static_cast<double>(num))`.
