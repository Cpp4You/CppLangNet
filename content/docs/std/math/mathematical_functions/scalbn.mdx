# Scalbn

Defined in header `<cmath>`.

### Description

Multiplies a floating point value `num` by `FLT_RADIX` raised to power `exp`. The library provides overloads of `std::scalbn` and `std::scalbln` 
for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter `num` (since C++23).
`Additional overloads` are provided for all integer types, which are treated as `double`.

### Declarations

<SwitchView content ={{
    "cpp23" : <Scalbn_Function_Declaration_Cpp23 />,
    "cpp11" : <Scalbn_Function_Declaration_Cpp11 />,
}}/>


### Parameters
 
`num` - floating-point or integer value
`exp` - integer value

### Return value

If no errors occur, `num` multiplied by `FLT_RADIX` to the power of `exp` (num×FLT_RADIX<sup>exp</sup>) is returned.

If a range error due to overflow occurs, `±HUGE_VAL`, `±HUGE_VALF`, or `±HUGE_VALL` is returned.

If a range error due to underflow occurs, the correct result (after rounding) is returned.

### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in math_errhandling.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559):

Unless a range error occurs, FE_INEXACT is never raised (the result is exact)
Unless a range error occurs, the current rounding mode is ignored
If `num` is `±0`, it is returned, unmodified
If `num` is `±∞`, it is returned, unmodified
If `exp` is `0`, then `num` is returned, unmodified
If `num` is NaN, NaN is returned

### Notes

On binary systems (where FLT_RADIX is 2), `std::scalbn` is equivalent to `std::ldexp`.

Although `std::scalbn` and `std::scalbln` are specified to perform the operation efficiently, 
on many implementations they are less efficient than multiplication or division by a power of two using arithmetic operators.

The function name stands for "new scalb", where *scalb* was an older non-standard function whose second argument had floating-point type.

The `std::scalbln` function is provided because the factor required to scale from the smallest positive floating-point value to the 
largest finite one may be greater than 32767, the standard-guaranteed `INT_MAX`. In particular, for the 80-bit long double, the factor is 32828.

The GNU implementation does not set errno regardless of math_errhandling.

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as `Additional overloads`. They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument `num` of integer type:

`std::scalbn(num, exp)` has the same effect as `std::scalbn(static_cast<double>(num), exp)` <br/>
`std::scalbln(num, exp)` has the same effect as `std::scalbln(static_cast<double>(num), exp)` <br/>
