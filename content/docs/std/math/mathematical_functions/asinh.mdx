# Asinh

Defined in header `<cmath>`.

### Description
Computes the inverse hyperbolic sine of `num`. The library provides overloads of `std::asinh` for all cv-unqualified 
floating-point types as the type of the parameter `num` (since C++23).
`Additional overloads` are provided for all integer types, which are treated as `double`.


### Declarations

<SwitchView content ={{
    "cpp23" : <Asinh_Function_Declaration_Cpp23 />,
    "cpp11" : <Asinh_Function_Declaration_Cpp11 />,
}}/>


### Parameters

`num` - floating-point or integer value

### Return value

If no errors occur, the inverse hyperbolic sine of `num` (sinh<sup>-1</sup>(num), or arsinh(num)) is returned.

If a range error occurs due to underflow, the correct result (after rounding) is returned.

### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in math_errhandling.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559):

if the argument is `±0` or `±∞`, it is returned unmodified
if the argument is NaN, NaN is returned


### Notes

Although the C standard (to which C++ refers for this function) names this function 
*"arc hyperbolic sine"*, the inverse functions of the hyperbolic functions are the area functions. 
Their argument is the area of a hyperbolic sector, not an arc. The correct name is *"inverse hyperbolic sine"* (used by POSIX) or *"area hyperbolic sine"*.

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as `Additional overloads`. 
They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument num of integer type, `std::asinh(num)` has the same effect as 
```cpp
std::asinh(static_cast<double>(num))
```

### Examples



<Columns spacing = "20px" columns={['6fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    std::cout 
        << "asinh(1) = " 
        << std::asinh(1) << '\n'
        << "asinh(-1) = " 
        << std::asinh(-1) << '\n';
 
    // special values
    std::cout 
        << "asinh(+0) = " 
        << std::asinh(+0.0) << '\n'
        << "asinh(-0) = " 
        <<  std::asinh(-0.0) << '\n';
}
