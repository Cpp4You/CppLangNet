# Rint

Defined in header `<cmath>`.

### Description

Rounds the floating-point argument `num` to an integer value (in floating-point format), using the current rounding mode. 
The library provides overloads of `std::rint` for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter `num` (since C++23).

`Rounding to long` and `Rounding to long long` Rounds the floating-point argument num to an integer value, using the current rounding mode. 
The library provides overloads of `std::lrint` and `std::llrint` for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter `num` (since C++23)

`Additional overloads` are provided for all integer types, which are treated as `double`.

### Declarations

<SwitchView content ={{
    "cpp23" : <Rint_Function_Declaration_Cpp23 />,
    "cpp11" : <Rint_Function_Declaration_Cpp11 />,
}}/>


### Parameters
 
`num` - floating-point or integer value

### Return value

If no errors occur, the nearest integer value to `num`, according to the current rounding mode, is returned

### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in math_errhandling.

If the result of `std::lrint` or `std::llrint` is outside the range representable by the return type, a domain error or a range error may occur.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559):

For the `std::rint` function:<br/>


If `num` is `±∞`, it is returned, unmodified<br/>
If `num` is `±0`, it is returned, unmodified<br/>
If `num` is NaN, NaN is returned<br/>

For `std::lrint` and `std::llrint` functions:<br/>


If `num` is `±∞`, FE_INVALID is raised and an implementation-defined value is returned<br/>
If the result of the rounding is outside the range of the return type, FE_INVALID is raised and an implementation-defined value is returned<br/>
If `num` is NaN, FE_INVALID is raised and an implementation-defined value is returned<br/>

### Notes

[POSIX](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/lrint.html) 
specifies that all cases where `std::lrint` or `std::llrint` raise FE_INEXACT are domain errors.

As specified in math_errhandling, FE_INEXACT may be (but isn't required to be on non-IEEE floating-point platforms) raised by `std::rint` when rounding a non-integer finite value.

The only difference between `std::rint` and `std::nearbyint` is that `std::nearbyint` **never** raises FE_INEXACT.

The largest representable floating-point values are exact integers in all standard floating-point formats, so std::rint never overflows on its own; however the result may overflow any integer type (including std::intmax_t), when stored in an integer variable.

If the current rounding mode is:

FE_DOWNWARD, then `std::rint` is equivalent to `std::floor`.
FE_UPWARD, then `std::rint` is equivalent to `std::ceil`.
FE_TOWARDZERO, then `std::rint` is equivalent to `std::trunc`
FE_TONEAREST, then `std::rint` differs from `std::round` in that halfway cases are rounded to even rather than away from zero.

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as `Additional Overloads`. They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument `num` of integer type:

`std::rint(num)` has the same effect as `std::rint(static_cast<double>(num))`.<br/>
`std::lrint(num)` has the same effect as `std::lrint(static_cast<double>(num))`.<br/>
`std::llrint(num)` has the same effect as `std::llrint(static_cast<double>(num))`.<br/>
