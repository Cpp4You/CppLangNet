# Fma

Defined in header `<cmath>`.

### Description

Computes `x * y + z` as if to infinite precision and rounded only once to fit the result type. 
The library provides overloads of `std::fma` for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameters `x`, `y` and `z`.

 If the macro constants `FP_FAST_FMA`, `FP_FAST_FMAF`, or `FP_FAST_FMAL` are defined, the function `std::fma` evaluates faster (in addition to being more precise) 
 than the expression `x * y + z` for `float`, `double`, and `long double` arguments, respectively. If defined, these macros evaluate to integer `1`.

### Declarations

<SwitchView content ={{
    "cpp23" : <Fma_Function_Declaration_Cpp23 />,
    "cpp11" : <Fma_Function_Declaration_Cpp11 />,
}}/>

### Parameters

`x`, `y`, `z` - floating-point or integer values


### Return Value

If successful, returns the value of `x * y + z` as if calculated to infinite precision and rounded once to fit the result type 
(or, alternatively, calculated as a single ternary floating-point operation)

If a range error due to overflow occurs, `±HUGE_VAL`, `±HUGE_VALF`, or `±HUGE_VALL` is returned.

If a range error due to underflow occurs, the correct value (after rounding) is returned.


### Error handling

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559):

If `x` is zero and `y` is infinite or if `x` is infinite and `y` is zero, and <br/>
if `z` is not a NaN, then NaN is returned and FE_INVALID is raised<br/>
if `z` is a NaN, then NaN is returned and FE_INVALID may be raised<br/>
If `x * y` is an exact infinity and `z` is an infinity with the opposite sign, NaN is returned and FE_INVALID is raised<br/>
If `x` or y are NaN, NaN is returned<br/>
If `z` is NaN, and `x * y` is not `0*Inf` or `Inf*0`, then NaN is returned (without FE_INVALID)<br/>

### Notes

This operation is commonly implemented in hardware as fused multiply-add CPU instruction. If supported by hardware, the appropriate `FP_FAST_FMA?` 
macros are expected to be defined, but many implementations make use of the CPU instruction even when the macros are not defined.

`POSIX (fma, fmaf, fmal)` additionally specifies that the situations specified to return `FE_INVALID` are domain errors.

Due to its infinite intermediate precision, `std::fma` is a common building block of other correctly-rounded mathematical operations, 
such as `std::sqrt` or even the division (where not provided by the CPU, e.g. Itanium).

As with all floating-point expressions, the expression `x * y + z` may be compiled as a fused multiply-add unless the `#pragma STDC FP_CONTRACT` is off.

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as in `Addition Overloads`. They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their first argument `num1`, 
second argument `num2` and third argument `num3`:

If `num1`, `num2` or `num3` has type `long double`, then <br/>
`std::fma(num1, num2, num3)` has the same effect as <br/>
`std::fma(static_cast<long double>(num1), static_cast<long double>(num2), static_cast<long double>(num3))`.

Otherwise, if `num1`, `num2` and/or `num3` has type `double` or an integer type, then <br/>
`std::fma(num1, num2, num3)` has the same effect as <br/>
`std::fma(static_cast<double>(num1), static_cast<double>(num2), static_cast<double>(num3))`.

Otherwise, if `num1`, `num2` or `num3` has type `float`, then <br/>
`std::fma(num1, num2, num3)` has the same effect as <br/>
`std::fma(static_cast<float>(num1), static_cast<float>(num2), static_cast<float>(num3))`.

If `num1`, `num2` and `num3` have arithmetic types, then <br/>
`std::fma(num1, num2, num3)` has the same effect as <br/> <code>std::fma(static_cast&lt;<span class='col-d'>/\* common-floating-point-type \*/</span>&gt;(num1), static_cast&lt;<span class='col-d'>/\* common-floating-point-type \*/</span>&gt;(num2), static_cast&lt;<span class='col-d'>/\* common-floating-point-type \*/</span>&gt;(num3))</code>

where <span class='col-d'>/\* common-floating-point-type \*/</span> is the floating-point type with the greatest floating-point conversion rank and greatest 
floating-point conversion subrank among the types of `num1`, `num2` and `num3`, 
arguments of integer type are considered to have the same floating-point conversion rank as `double`.

If no such floating-point type with the greatest rank and subrank exists, then overload resolution does not result in a usable candidate from the overloads provided.
