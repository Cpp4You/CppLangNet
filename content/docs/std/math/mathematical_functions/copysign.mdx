# Copysign

Defined in header `<cmath>`.

### Description

Composes a floating point value with the magnitude of `mag` and the sign of `sgn`. <br/>
The library provides overloads of `std::copysign` for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameters `mag` and `sgn` (since C++23). <br/>
`Additional overloads` are provided for all other combinations of arithmetic types.


### Declarations

<SwitchView content ={{
    "cpp23" : <Copysign_Function_Declaration_Cpp23 />,
    "cpp11" : <Copysign_Function_Declaration_Cpp11 />,
}}/>


### Parameters
 
`mag`, `sgn` - floating-point or integer values

### Return value

If no errors occur, the floating point value with the magnitude of `mag` and the sign of `sgn` is returned.

If `mag` is NaN, then NaN with the sign of `sgn` is returned.

If `sgn` is `-0`, the result is only negative if the implementation supports the signed zero consistently in arithmetic operations.

### Error handling

This function is not subject to any errors specified in math_errhandling.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559):

The returned value is exact (FE_INEXACT is never raised) and independent of the current rounding mode.

### Notes

`std::copysign` is the only portable way to manipulate the sign of a NaN value (to examine the sign of a NaN, `std::signbit` may also be used).

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as `Additional overloads`. 
They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their first argument `num1` and second argument `num2`:

If `num1` or `num2` has type `long double`, then <br/>
`std::copysign(num1, num2)` has the same effect as  <br/>
`std::copysign(static_cast<long double>(num1), static_cast<long double>(num2))`.

Otherwise, if `num1` and/or `num2` has type `double` or an integer type, then  <br/>
`std::copysign(num1, num2)` has the same effect as  <br/>
`std::copysign(static_cast<double>(num1), static_cast<double>(num2))`.

Otherwise, if `num1` or `num2` has type `float`, then  <br/>
`std::copysign(num1, num2)` has the same effect as  <br/>
`std::copysign(static_cast<float>(num1), static_cast<float>(num2))`. (until C++23)

If `num1` and `num2` have arithmetic types, then  <br/>
`std::copysign(num1, num2)` has the same effect as  <br/>
`std::copysign(static_cast</* common-floating-point-type */>(num1), static_cast</* common-floating-point-type */>(num2)) `, 

where `/* common-floating-point-type */` is the floating-point type with the greatest floating-point conversion rank and greatest floating-point 
conversion subrank between the types of `num1` and `num2`, arguments of integer type are considered to have the same floating-point conversion rank as `double`.

If no such floating-point type with the greatest rank and subrank exists, then overload resolution does not result in a usable candidate from the overloads provided.
