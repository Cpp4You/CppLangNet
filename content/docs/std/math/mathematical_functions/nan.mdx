# NAN

### Description

The macro `NAN` expands to constant expression of type <span class='col-lb'>float</span> which evaluates to a quiet not-a-number (`QNaN`) value. 
If the implementation does not support `QNaN`s, this macro constant is not defined.


### Declarations
```cpp
#define NAN /*implementation defined*/
```

### Notes
There are many different `NaN` values, differentiated by their payloads and their sign bits. 
The contents of the payload and the sign bit of the `NaN` generated by the macro `NAN` are implementation-defined.
