# Isgreaterequal

Defined in header `<cmath>`.

### Description

Determines if the floating point number `x` is greater than or equal to the floating-point number `y`, without setting floating-point exceptions. 
The library provides overloads for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameters `x` and `y` (since C++23). <br/>
`Additional overloads` are provided for all other combinations of arithmetic types.

### Declarations

<SwitchView content ={{
    "cpp23" : <Isgreaterequal_Function_Declaration_Cpp23 />,
    "cpp11" : <Isgreaterequal_Function_Declaration_Cpp11 />,
}}/>


### Parameters
 
`x`, `y` - floating-point or integer values

### Return value

`true` if `x >= y`, `false` otherwise.

### Notes

The built-in operator `>=` for floating-point numbers may set `FE_INVALID` if one or both of the arguments is `NaN`. This function is a "quiet" version of operator `>=` .

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as `Additional overloads`. 
They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their first argument `num1` and second argument `num2`:

If `num1` or `num2` has type `long double`, then <br/>
`std::isgreaterequal(num1, num2)` has the same effect as  <br/>
`std::isgreaterequal(static_cast<long double>(num1), static_cast<long double>(num2))`.

Otherwise, if `num1` and/or `num2` has type `double` or an integer type, then  <br/>
`std::isgreaterequal(num1, num2)` has the same effect as  <br/>
`std::isgreaterequal(static_cast<double>(num1), static_cast<double>(num2))`.

Otherwise, if `num1` or `num2` has type `float`, then  <br/>
`std::isgreaterequal(num1, num2)` has the same effect as  <br/>
`std::isgreaterequal(static_cast<float>(num1), static_cast<float>(num2))`.
(until C++23)

If `num1` and `num2` have arithmetic types, then  <br/>
`std::isgreaterequal(num1, num2)` has the same effect as  <br/>
`std::isgreaterequal(static_cast</* common-floating-point-type */>(num1), static_cast</* common-floating-point-type */>(num2))`, 
               
where `/* common-floating-point-type */` is the floating-point type with the greatest floating-point conversion rank and greatest floating-point 
conversion subrank between the types of `num1` and `num2`, arguments of integer type are considered to have the same floating-point conversion rank as `double`.

If no such floating-point type with the greatest rank and subrank exists, then overload resolution does not result in a usable candidate from the overloads provided.
