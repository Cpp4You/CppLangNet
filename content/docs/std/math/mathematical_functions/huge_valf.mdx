# HUGE_VALF, HUGE_VAL, HUGE_VALL

### Description

The macros `HUGE_VALF`, `HUGE_VAL` and `HUGE_VALL` macros expand to positive 
floating point constant expressions which compare equal to the values returned by floating-point functions and operators in case of overflow 
(see [math_errhandling](/docs/std/math/mathematical_functions/math_errhandling/)).

| Constant  | Explanation                                                                                                            |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HUGE_VALF | Expands to positive float expression that indicates overflow                                                           |
| HUGE_VAL  | Expands to positive double expression that indicates overflow, not necessarily representable as a float                |
| HUGE_VALL | Expands to positive long double expression that indicates overflow, not necessarily representable as a float or double |

On implementations that support floating-point infinities, these macros always expand to the positive infinities of `float`, `double`, and `long double`, respectively.



### Declarations 

```cpp
#define HUGE_VAL  /* implementation defined */
```

`Since C++11`

```cpp
#define HUGE_VALF /* implementation defined */

#define HUGE_VALL /* implementation defined */
```


### Notes

On implementations that do not support floating-point infinities, these macros expand to the maximum finite number of their respective types.

C++98 added `float` and `long double` overloads of mathematical functions. 
There is a problem that the `float` overloads cannot return `HUGE_VAL` to indicate overflow because this macro is not guaranteed to be representable as a `float`.

LWG issue 357 was raised to target this problem. LWG found that C99 has the same problem (`float` and `long double` overloads were also added in C99), 
and C99 introduced new macros `HUGE_VALF` and `HUGE_VALL` to solve the problem. Therefore the issue was closed and the C99 resolution was adopted in C++11.
