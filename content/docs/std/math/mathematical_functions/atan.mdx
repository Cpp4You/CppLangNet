# Atan

Defined in header `<cmath>`.

### Description

Computes the principal value of the arc tangent of `num`. 
The library provides overloads of `std::atan` for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter `num` (since C++23).
`Additional overloads` are provided for all integer types, which are treated as `double`
(since C++11).


### Declarations

<SwitchView content ={{
    "cpp23" : <Atan_Function_Declaration_Cpp23 />,
    "cpp11" : <Atan_Function_Declaration_Cpp11 />,
}}/>


### Parameters
 
`num` - floating-point or integer value

### Return value

If no errors occur, the arc tangent of `num` (arctan(num)) in the range `[-π/2, π/2]` radians, is returned.
If a range error occurs due to underflow, the correct result (after rounding) is returned.

### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in math_errhandling.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559):

If the argument is `±0`, it is returned unmodified
If the argument is `+∞`, `+π/2` is returned
If the argument is `-∞`, `-π/2` is returned
if the argument is NaN, NaN is returned

### Notes
[POSIX](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/atan.html) 
specifies that in case of underflow, `num` is returned unmodified, 
and if that is not supported, an implementation-defined value no greater than `DBL_MIN`, `FLT_MIN`, and `LDBL_MIN` is returned.

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as `Additional overloads`. 
They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument num of integer type, 
`std::atan(num)` has the same effect as `std::atan(static_cast<double>(num))`.

### Examples

<div>

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>

        << atan(1) << '\n'
        << "4*atan(1) = " 
        << 4 * atan(1) << '\n';
 
    // special values
    std::cout 
        << "atan(Inf) = " 
        << atan(INFINITY) << '\n'
        << "2*atan(Inf) = " 
        << 2 * atan(INFINITY) << '\n'
        << "atan(-0.0) = " 
        << atan(-0.0) << '\n'
