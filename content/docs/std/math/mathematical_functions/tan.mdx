# Tan

Defined in header `<cmath>`.

### Description

Computes the tangent of `num` (measured in radians). The library provides overloads of `std::tan` for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter num. (since C++23)
`Additional overloads` are provided for all integer types, which are treated as `double`.(since C++11)



### Declarations

<SwitchView content ={{
    "cpp23" : <Tan_Function_Declaration_Cpp23 />,
    "cpp11" : <Tan_Function_Declaration_Cpp11 />,
}}/>


### Parameters
 
`num`	-	floating-point or integer value representing angle in radians

### Return value

If no errors occur, the tangent of `num` (tan(num)) is returned.

The result may have little or no significance if the magnitude of `num` is large. (until C++11)

If a domain error occurs, an implementation-defined value is returned (NaN where supported).

If a range error occurs due to underflow, the correct result (after rounding) is returned.

### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in math_errhandling.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559):

if the argument is `±0`, it is returned unmodified <br/>
if the argument is `±∞`, NaN is returned and `FE_INVALID` is raised<br/>
if the argument is NaN, NaN is returned<br/>

### Notes
The case where the argument is infinite is not specified to be a domain error in C (to which C++ defers), but it is defined as a domain error in 
[POSIX](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/tan.html).

The function has mathematical poles at `π(1/2 + n)`; however no common floating-point representation is able to represent `π/2` exactly,
 thus there is no value of the argument for which a pole error occurs.

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as `Additional overloads`.
They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument `num` of integer type, <br/>
`std::tan(num)` has the same effect as `std::tan(static_cast<double>(num))`.
