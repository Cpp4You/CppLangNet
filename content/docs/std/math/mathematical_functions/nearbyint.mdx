# Nearbyint

Defined in header `<cmath>`.

### Description

Rounds the floating-point argument `num` to an integer value in floating-point format, using the current rounding mode. 
The library provides overloads of `std::nearbyint` for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter `num` <Since v='cpp23'></Since>.
<a href='#declarations'><code><b>Additional Overloads</b></code></a> are provided for all integer types, which are treated as `double`.

### Declarations

<SwitchView content ={{
    "cpp23" : <Nearbyint_Function_Declaration_Cpp23 />,
    "cpp11" : <Nearbyint_Function_Declaration_Cpp11 />,
}}/>


### Parameters
 
`num` - floating-point or integer value

### Return value

The nearest integer value to `num`, according to the current rounding mode, is returned.

### Error handling

This function is not subject to any of the errors specified in math_errhandling.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559):

FE_INEXACT is never raised <br/>
If `num` is `±∞`, it is returned, unmodified<br/>
If `num` is `±0`, it is returned, unmodified<br/>
If `num` is NaN, NaN is returned<br/>

### Notes

The only difference between `std::nearbyint` and <a href='/docs/std/math/mathematical_functions/rint'><code>std::rint</code></a> is that `std::nearbyint` never raises FE_INEXACT.

The largest representable floating-point values are exact integers in all standard floating-point formats, so `std::nearbyint` 
never overflows on its own; however the result may overflow any integer type (including `std::intmax_t`), when stored in an integer variable.

If the current rounding mode is FE_TONEAREST, this function rounds to even in halfway cases (like <a href='/docs/std/math/mathematical_functions/rint'><code>std::rint</code></a>, but unlike <a href='/docs/std/math/mathematical_functions/round'><code>std::round</code></a>).

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as <a href='#declarations'><code><b>Additional Overloads</b></code></a>. 

They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument `num` of integer type, 
`std::nearbyint(num)` has the same effect as `std::nearbyint(static_cast<double>(num))`.
