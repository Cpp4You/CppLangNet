# Nearbyint

Defined in header `<cmath>`.

### Description

Rounds the floating-point argument <code>num</code> to an integer value in floating-point format, using the current rounding mode. <br/>
&#8203;<Since v='cpp23'>The library provides overloads of `std::nearbyint` for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter <code>num</code> </Since>.<br/>

&#8203;<a href='#declarations'>Additional Overloads</a> are provided for all integer types, which are treated as <span class='col-lb'>double</span>.

### Declarations

<VersionTabs content ={{
    "cpp23" : <Nearbyint_Function_Declaration_Cpp23 />,
    "cpp11" : <Nearbyint_Function_Declaration_Cpp11 />,
}}/>

### Parameters
 
&#8203;<code>num</code> - floating-point or integer value

### Return value

The nearest integer value to <code>num</code>, according to the current rounding mode, is returned.

### Error handling

This function is not subject to any of the errors specified in math_errhandling.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (<a href='https://www.iso.org/standard/80985.html'>IEC 60559</a>):

FE_INEXACT is never raised <br/>
If <code>num</code> is `±∞`, it is returned, unmodified<br/>
If <code>num</code> is `±0`, it is returned, unmodified<br/>
If <code>num</code> is NaN, NaN is returned<br/>

### Notes

The only difference between `std::nearbyint` and <a href='/docs/std/math/mathematical_functions/rint'><code>std::rint</code></a> is that `std::nearbyint` never raises FE_INEXACT.

The largest representable floating-point values are exact integers in all standard floating-point formats, so `std::nearbyint` 
never overflows on its own; however the result may overflow any integer type (including `std::intmax_t`), when stored in an integer variable.

If the current rounding mode is FE_TONEAREST, this function rounds to even in halfway cases (like <a href='/docs/std/math/mathematical_functions/rint'><code>std::rint</code></a>, but unlike <a href='/docs/std/math/mathematical_functions/round'><code>std::round</code></a>).

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as <a href='#declarations'>Additional Overloads</a>. 

They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument <code>num</code> of integer type, 
`std::nearbyint(num)` has the same effect as <code>std::nearbyint(<a href='/docs/std/lang-support/static_cast'>static_cast</a>&lt;<span class='col-lb'>double</span>&gt;(num))</code>.
