# INFINITY

### Description

If the implementation supports floating-point infinities, the macro `INFINITY` expands to constant expression of type float which evaluates to positive or unsigned infinity.

If the implementation does not support floating-point infinities, the macro `INFINITY` expands to a positive value that is guaranteed to overflow a 
<span class='col-lb'>float</span> at compile time, and the use of this macro generates a compiler warning.


### Declarations
```cpp
#define INFINITY /*implementation defined*/
```
