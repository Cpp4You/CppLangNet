# Fmod

Defined in header `<cmath>`.

### Description

The floating-point remainder of the division operation `x / y` calculated by this function is exactly the value `x - rem * y`, where rem is `x / y` with its fractional part truncated.

The returned value has the same sign as `x` and is less than `y` in magnitude.

### Declarations 
<SwitchView content={{
    "cpp23": <Fmod_Function_Declaration_Cpp23 />,
    "cpp11": <Fmod_Function_Declaration_Cpp11 />,
}}/>

### Parameters

`x`, `y`	-	floating-point or integer values

### Return Value
If successful, returns the floating-point remainder of the division `x / y` as defined above.

If a domain error occurs, an implementation-defined value is returned (NaN where supported).

If a range error occurs due to underflow, the correct result (after rounding) is returned.

### Error Handling

Domain error may occur if `y` is zero.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559),

If `x` is ±0 and `y` is not zero, ±0 is returned <br/>
If `x` is ±∞ and `y` is not NaN, NaN is returned and FE_INVALID is raised <br/>
If `y` is ±0 and `x` is not NaN, NaN is returned and FE_INVALID is raised <br/>
If `y` is ±∞ and `x` is finite, `x` is returned. <br/>
If either argument is NaN, NaN is returned



### Notes

POSIX requires that a domain error occurs if `x` is infinite or `y` is zero.

`std::fmod`, but not `std::remainder` is useful for doing silent wrapping of floating-point types to unsigned integer types: 
`(0.0 <= (y = std::fmod(std::rint(x), 65536.0)) ? y : 65536.0 + y)` is in the range `[-0.0 .. 65535.0]`, 
which corresponds to unsigned short, but `std::remainder(std::rint(x), 65536.0)` is in the range `[-32767.0, +32768.0]`, 
which is outside of the range of signed short.

The double version of `std::fmod` behaves as if implemented as follows:

```cpp
double fmod(double x, double y)
{
#pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON
    double result = std::remainder(std::fabs(x), y = std::fabs(y));
    if (std::signbit(result))
        result += y;
    return std::copysign(result, x);
}
```

The expression `x - std::trunc(x / y) * y` may not equal `std::fmod(x, y)`, when the rounding of `x / y` to initialize the argument of `std::trunc` loses too much precision (example: `x = 30.508474576271183309`, `y = 6.1016949152542370172`).

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as (A). They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their first argument `num1` and second argument `num2`:

If `num1` or `num2` has type long double, then `std::fmod(num1, num2)` has the same effect as
```cpp
std::fmod(static_cast<long double>(num1),
          static_cast<long double>(num2))
```
Otherwise, if `num1` and/or `num2` has type double or an integer type, then `std::fmod(num1, num2)` has the same effect as 
```cpp
std::fmod(static_cast<double>(num1),
          static_cast<double>(num2))
```
Otherwise, if `num1` or `num2` has type float, then `std::fmod(num1, num2)` has the same effect as 
```cpp
std::fmod(static_cast<float>(num1),
          static_cast<float>(num2))
```

If `num1` and `num2` have arithmetic types, then `std::fmod(num1, num2)` has the same effect as 
```cpp
std::fmod(static_cast</* common-floating-point-type */>(num1),
          static_cast</* common-floating-point-type */>(num2))
```
where `/* common-floating-point-type */` is the floating-point type with the greatest floating-point conversion rank and greatest floating-point conversion subrank between the types of `num1` and `num2`, arguments of integer type are considered to have the same floating-point conversion rank as double.

If no such floating-point type with the greatest rank and subrank exists, then overload resolution does not result in a usable candidate from the overloads provided.
