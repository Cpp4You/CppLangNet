# Trunc

Defined in header `<cmath>`.

### Description

Computes the nearest integer not greater in magnitude than `num`. The library provides overloads of `std::trunc` 
for all cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter `num` (since C++23).

`Additional overloads` are provided for all integer types, which are treated as `double`.

### Declarations

<SwitchView content ={{
    "cpp23" : <Trunc_Function_Declaration_Cpp23 />,
    "cpp11" : <Trunc_Function_Declaration_Cpp11 />,
}}/>


### Parameters
 
`num` - floating-point or integer value

### Return value

If no errors occur, the nearest integer value not greater in magnitude than `num` (in other words, `num` rounded towards zero) is returned.

    />

### Error handling

Errors are reported as specified in math_errhandling.

If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC 60559):

The current rounding mode has no effect. <br/>
If `num` is `±∞`, it is returned, unmodified<br/>
If `num` is `±0`, it is returned, unmodified<br/>
If `num` is NaN, NaN is returned<br/>

### Notes

FE_INEXACT may be (but isn't required to be) raised when truncating a non-integer finite value.

The largest representable floating-point values are exact integers in all standard floating-point formats, 
so this function never overflows on its own; however the result may overflow any integer type (including std::intmax_t), when stored in an integer variable.

The implicit conversion from floating-point to integral types also rounds towards zero, 
but is limited to the values that can be represented by the target type.

The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as `additional overloads`. 
They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument `num` of integer type, <br/>
`std::trunc(num)` has the same effect as `std::trunc(static_cast<double>(num))`.

### Examples



<Columns spacing = "20px" columns={['6fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp
#include <cmath>
#include <initializer_list>
#include <iostream>
 
int main()
{
    const auto data = std::initializer_list<double>
    {
        +2.7, -2.9, +0.7, -0.9, +0.0, 0.0, -INFINITY, +INFINITY, -NAN, +NAN
    };
 
    std::cout << std::showpos;
    for (double const x : data)
        std::cout << "trunc(" << x << ") == " 
        << std::trunc(x) << '\n';
}

```
