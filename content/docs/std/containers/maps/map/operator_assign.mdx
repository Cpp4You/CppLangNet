Replaces the contents of the containter.

 - **(1)** **Copy** assignment operator. Replaces the contents with a copy of the contents of `other`.
    <SwitchView content={{
		    'since-cpp11': <PropagateOnContainerChange_SinceCpp11 />,
	    }}/>

    If ``std::allocator_traits<allocator_type>::propagate_on_container_copy_assignment::value` is `true`, the allocator of `*this` is replaced by a copy of that of `other`.
    
    If the allocator of `*this` after assignment would compare unequal to its old value, the old allocator is used to deallocate the memory,
    then the new allocator is used to allocate it before copying the elements.
    Otherwise, the memory owned by `*this` may be reused when possible. In any case, the elements originally belong to `*this` may be either destroyed or replaced by element-wise copy-assignment.

 - **(2)** **Move** assignment operator. Replaces the contents with those of other using move semantics (i.e. the data in other is moved from other into this container).
:::important
`other` is in a valid but unspecified state afterwards.
:::
    If `std::allocator_traits<Alloc>::propagate_on_container_move_assignment::value` is `true`, the allocator of `*this` is replaced by a copy of that of other.
    If it is false and the allocators of `*this` and other do not compare equal, `*this` cannot take ownership of the memory owned by other and must move-assign each element individually,
    allocating additional memory using its own allocator as needed.
    
    In any case, all elements originally belong to `*this` are either destroyed or replaced by element-wise move-assignment.

### Parameters

 - `other` - another container to use as data source
 - `ilist` - initializer list to use as data source

### Return value

A reference to the container, `*this`.

### Exceptions

<SwitchView content={{
		'since-cpp17': <NoexceptSpecification_SinceCpp17 />,
		'until-cpp17': <> May throw implementation-defined exceptions. </>
	}}/>

### Complexity

 - **(1)** Linear in the size of `*this` and `other`.
 - **(2)** Linear in the size of `*this` unless the allocators do not compare equal and do not propagate, in which case linear in the size of `*this` and `other`.
 - **(3)** **O(NlogN)** in general, where **N** is `size() + ilist.size()`. Linear if ilist is sorted with respect to [`value_comp()`](/docs/std/containers/maps/map/value_comp).

### Notes
After container move assignment (overload **(2)**), unless element-wise move assignment is forced by incompatible allocators, references, pointers,
and iterators (other than the end iterator) to other remain valid, but refer to elements that are now in `*this`.
The current standard makes this guarantee via the blanket statement in `[container.requirements.general]/12`, and a more direct guarantee is under consideration via **LWG 2321**.

<div>

```plaintext title="Output"
Initially:
x = { {1,1}, {2,2}, {3,3} }
y = { }
z = { }
Copy assignment copies data from x to y:
x = { {1,1}, {2,2}, {3,3} }
y = { {1,1}, {2,2}, {3,3} }
Move assignment moves data from x to z, modifying both x and z:
x = { }
z = { {1,1}, {2,2}, {3,3} }
Assignment of initializer_list w to z:
w = { {4,4}, {5,5}, {6,6}, {7,7} }
z = { {4,4}, {5,5}, {6,6}, {7,7} }
```
