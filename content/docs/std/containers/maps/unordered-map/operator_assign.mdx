Replaces the contents of the container with the contents of another.

 - **(1)** **Copy** assignment operator. Replaces the contents with a copy of the contents of `other`.
    If `std::allocator_traits<allocator_type>::propagate_on_container_copy_assignment::value` is `true`, the allocator of `*this` is replaced by a copy of that of `other`.
    
    If the allocator of `*this` after assignment would compare unequal to its old value, the old allocator is used to deallocate the memory,
    then the new allocator is used to allocate it before copying the elements.

    Otherwise, the memory owned by `*this` may be reused when possible. In any case, the elements originally belong to `*this` may be either destroyed or replaced by element-wise copy-assignment.

 - **(2)** **Move** assignment operator. Replaces the contents with those of other using move semantics (i.e. the data in other is moved from other into this container).
:::important
`other` is in a valid but unspecified state afterwards.
:::
    If `std::allocator_traits<Alloc>::propagate_on_container_move_assignment::value` is `true`, the allocator of `*this` is replaced by a copy of that of other.

    If it is false and the allocators of `*this` and other do not compare equal, `*this` cannot take ownership of the memory owned by other and must move-assign each element individually,
    allocating additional memory using its own allocator as needed.
    
    In any case, all elements originally belong to `*this` are either destroyed or replaced by element-wise move-assignment.
            
 - **(3)** Replaces the contents with those identified by initializer list `ilist`.

### Parameters

 - `other` - another container to use as data source
 - `ilist` - initializer list to use as data source
 
### Return value

`*this`

### Complexity

 - **(1)** Linear in the size of `*this` and `other` - **O(size() + other.size())**
 - **(2)**  
	Linear in the size of `*this` - **O(size())**.  
	If the allocators do not compare equal and do not propagate, linear in the size of `*this` and other - **O(size() + other.size())**.
 - **(3)** Linear in the size of `*this` and `ilist` - **O(size() + ilist.size())**.

### Exceptions

<SwitchView content={{
        'since-cpp17': <NoexceptSpecification_SinceCpp17 />,
        'until-cpp17': <> 
			May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
        </>
    }} />

### Notes

After container move assignment (overload **(2)**), unless element-wise move assignment is forced by incompatible allocators, references, pointers,
and iterators (other than the end iterator) to other remain valid, but refer to elements that are now in `*this`.
The current standard makes this guarantee via the blanket statement in `[container.requirements.general]/12`, and a more direct guarantee is under consideration via [**LWG 2321**](https://cplusplus.github.io/LWG/issue2321).

    std::cout << "Move assignment moves data from x to z, modifying both x and z:\n";
    z = std::move(x);

```plaintext title="Possible output"
Initially:
x = { {3,3}, {2,2}, {1,1} }
y = { }
z = { }
Copy assignment copies data from x to y:
x = { {3,3}, {2,2}, {1,1} }
y = { {3,3}, {2,2}, {1,1} }
Move assignment moves data from x to z, modifying both x and z:
x = { }
z = { {3,3}, {2,2}, {1,1} }
Assignment of initializer_list w to z:
w = { {4,4}, {5,5}, {6,6}, {7,7} }
z = { {7,7}, {6,6}, {5,5}, {4,4} }
```
