If `std::allocator_traits<allocator_type>::propagate_on_container_copy_assignment::value` is `true`, the allocator of `*this` is replaced by a copy of that of `other`.

If the allocator of `*this` after assignment would compare unequal to its old value, the old allocator is used to deallocate the memory, then the new allocator is used to allocate it before copying the elements.

Otherwise, the memory owned by `*this` may be reused when possible. In any case, the elements originally belong to `*this` may be either destroyed or replaced by element-wise copy-assignment.
