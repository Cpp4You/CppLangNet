The type of the underlying container used to store the elements. By default [`std::vector<T>`](/docs/containers/arrays/vector).

The container must satisfy [SequenceContainer](/docs/named_req/SequenceContainer) and it's iterators must satisfy [LegacyRandomAccesIterator](/docs/named_req/LegacyRandomAccesIterator).  
Additionally, it must provide the following functions with the usual semantics:
 - `back()`
 - `front()`
 - `push_back()`
 - `pop_front()`

The standard containers [`std::vector`](/docs/containers/arrays/vector) and [`std::deque`](/docs/containers/queues/queue) satisfy these requirements.
