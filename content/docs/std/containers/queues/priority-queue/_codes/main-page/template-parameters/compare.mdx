A [Compare](/docs/named_req/Compare) type providing a **strict weak** ordering.

:::note
The **Compare** parameter is defined such that it returns `true` if its first argument comes before its second argument in a **weak** ordering.  
But because the priority queue outputs largest elements first, the elements that "come before" are actually output last.
That is, the front of the queue contains the "last" element according to the weak ordering imposed by **Compare**.
