```cpp
// 1)
vector()
    : vector( Allocator() )
{
}

// 2)
explicit vector( Allocator const& alloc );
```

<!-- Optional description here  -->

- constructor 1) is `noexcept` if constructor of the `Allocator` is `noexcept` as well
- constructor 2) is `noexcept`, because `Allocator` was constructed before
- both constructors are `constexpr`
