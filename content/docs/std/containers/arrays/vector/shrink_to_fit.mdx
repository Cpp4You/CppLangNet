Requests the removal of unused capacity.
It is a non-binding request to reduce [`capacity()`](capacity) to [`size()`](size).
It depends on the implementation whether the request is fulfilled.

:::caution Invalidation
If reallocation occurs, all **iterators**, including the **past-the-end iterator**, and all **references** to the elements are invalidated.

If no reallocation takes place, **no iterators or references** are invalidated.
:::

### Parameters

**(none)**

### Type requirements
- `T` *(the container's element type)* must meet the requirements of [`MoveInsertable`](/docs/named_req/MoveInsertable).

### Return value

**(none)**

### Complexity

At most linear in the size of the container - **O(size())**.

### Exceptions

If an exception is thrown other than by `T`'s move constructor, there are no effects ([**strong exception guarantee**](#)).

### Example

<Columns columns={['8fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title='Main.cpp' showLineNumbers
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
 
int main()
{
    std::vector<int> v;
    std::cout << "Default-constructed capacity is " << v.capacity() << '\n';
    v.resize(100);
    std::cout << "Capacity of a 100-element vector is " << v.capacity() << '\n';
    v.resize(50);
    std::cout << "Capacity after resize(50) is " << v.capacity() << '\n';
    v.shrink_to_fit();
    std::cout << "Capacity after shrink_to_fit() is " << v.capacity() << '\n';
    v.clear();
    std::cout << "Capacity after clear() is " << v.capacity() << '\n';
    v.shrink_to_fit();
    std::cout << "Capacity after shrink_to_fit() is " << v.capacity() << '\n';
    for (int i = 1000; i < 1300; ++i)
        v.push_back(i);
    std::cout << "Capacity after adding 300 elements is " << v.capacity() << '\n';
    v.shrink_to_fit();
    std::cout << "Capacity after shrink_to_fit() is " << v.capacity() << '\n';
}
```

</div>

```plaintext title="Possible output"
Default-constructed capacity is 0
Capacity of a 100-element vector is 100
Capacity after resize(50) is 100
Capacity after shrink_to_fit() is 50

Capacity after shrink_to_fit() is 0
