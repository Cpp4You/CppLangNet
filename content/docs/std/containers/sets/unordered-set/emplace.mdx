# std::unordered_set emplace() method

<SwitchView content={{
	'since-cpp11': <Method_SinceCpp11 />,
	}} />

Inserts a new element into the container constructed in-place with the given `args` if there is no element with the key in the container.

Careful use of emplace allows the new element to be constructed while avoiding unnecessary copy or move operations.

The constructor of the new element is called with exactly the same arguments as supplied to emplace, forwarded via `std::forward<Args>(args)...`. 
The element may be constructed even if there already is an element with the key in the container, in which case the newly constructed element will be destroyed immediately..

:::danger Invalidation
If rehashing occurs due to the insertion, **all iterators** are invalidated.

Otherwise iterators are not affected. References are not invalidated.

Rehashing occurs only if the new number of elements is greater than `max_load_factor() * bucket_count()`.
:::

### Parameters

 - `args` - arguments to forward to the constructor of the element

### Return value

Returns a pair consisting of an iterator to the inserted element, or the already-existing element if no insertion happened,
and a `bool` denoting whether the insertion took place (`true` if insertion happened, `false` if it did not).

### Complexity

Average case, constant - **O(1)**.  
Worst case, linear in size of the container - **O(size())**.

### Exceptions

If an exception is thrown by any operation, this function has no effect (strong exception guarantee).
