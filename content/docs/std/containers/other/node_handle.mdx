# Node handle <Version v='cpp17'></Version>

```cpp title="Since C++17"
template</* unspecified */>
class /* node-handle */;
```

Associative containers 
[std::set](/docs/std/containers/sets/set), [std::map](/docs/std/containers/maps/map), 
[std::multiset](/docs/std/containers/sets/multiset), [std::multimap](/docs/std/containers/maps/multimap), 
[std::unordered_set](/docs/std/containers/sets/unordered_set), [std::unordered_map](/docs/std/containers/maps/unordered_map),
[std::unordered_multiset](/docs/std/containers/sets/unordered_multiset), [std::unordered_multimap](/docs/std/containers/maps/unordered_multimap), 
are node-based data structures, and their nodes can be extracted as an object of unspecified type known as node handle.

Node handle is a move-only type that owns and provides access to the element (the value_type) stored in the node, 
and provides non-const access to the key part of the element (the key_type) and the mapped part of the element (the mapped_type). 
If the node handle destructs while holding the node, the node is properly destructed using the appropriate allocator for the container. 
The node handle contains a copy of the containerâ€™s allocator. This is necessary so that the node handle can outlive the container.

The exact type of node handle (shown here as */\* node-handle \*/*) is unspecified, 
but each container exposes its node handle type as the member node_type.

Node handles can be used to transfer ownership of an element between two associative containers with the same key, value, and allocator type 
(ignoring comparison or hash/equality), 
without invoking any copy/move operations on the container element (this kind of operation is known as "splicing"). 
Transfer between unique and non-unique containers is also permitted: 
a node handle from a [std::map](/docs/std/containers/maps/map) can be inserted into an [std::multimap](/docs/std/containers/maps/multimap), 
but not into [std::unordered_map](/docs/std/containers/maps/unordered_map) or [std::set](/docs/std/containers/sets/set).

A node handle may be empty, in which case it holds no element and no allocator. 
The default-constructed and moved-from node handle is empty. 
In addition, an empty node handle can be produced by a failed call to container member function extract.

Pointers and references to an element that are obtained while it is owned by a node handle are invalidated if the element is successfully inserted into a container.

For all map containers ([std::map](/docs/std/containers/maps/map), [std::multimap](/docs/std/containers/maps/multimap), 
[std::unordered_map](/docs/std/containers/maps/unordered_map), and [std::unordered_multimap](/docs/std/containers/maps/unordered_multimap)) 
whose key_type is K and mapped_type is T, 
the behavior of operations involving node handles is undefined if a user-defined specialization of [std::pair](/docs/std/utility/pair) exists for 
[std::pair](/docs/std/utility/pair)&lt;K, T&gt; or [std::pair](/docs/std/utility/pair)&lt;const K, T&gt;.

### Member functions

---
#### <big><big>constructors</big></big>
```cpp
// 1)
constexpr /* node-handle */() noexcept;
// 2)
/* node-handle */ (/* node-handle */&& nh) noexcept;
```
1) The default constructor initializes the node handle to the empty state. <br/>
2) The move constructor takes ownership of the container element from `nh`, 
move-constructs the member allocator, and leaves `nh` in the empty state.

#### Parameters
`nh`	-	a node handle with the same type (not necessarily the same container)
#### Notes
Node handles are move-only, the copy constructor is not defined.

---
#### <big><big>operator=</big></big>
```cpp
/* node-handle */& operator=(/* node-handle */&& nh);
```
* If the node handle is not empty,
    * destroys the value_type subobject in the container element object managed by this node handle by 
    calling `std::allocator_traits<allocator_type>::destroy;`
    * deallocates the container element by calling `std::allocator_traits<allocator_type>::rebind_traits</* container-node-type */>::deallocate;`
* Acquires ownership of the container element from `nh`;
* If node handle was empty (and so did not contain an allocator) or if `std::allocator_traits<allocator_type>::propagate_on_container_move_assignment` is true, 
move-assigns the allocator from `nh`;
* sets `nh` to the empty state.

The behavior is undefined if the node is not empty and `std::allocator_traits<allocator_type>::propagate_on_container_move_assignment` is false 
and the allocators do not compare equal.
#### Parameters
`nh`	-	node handle with the same type (not necessarily the same container)
#### Return
`*this`
#### Exceptions
Throws nothing.
#### Notes
Node handles are move-only, the copy assignment is not defined.

---
#### <big><big>destructor</big></big>
```cpp
~/* node-handle */();
```
* If the node handle is not empty,
    * destroys the value_type subobject in the container element object managed by this node handle by calling 
    `std::allocator_traits<allocator_type>::destroy;`
    * deallocates the container element by calling `std::allocator_traits<allocator_type>::rebind_traits</* container-node-type */>::deallocate`.

---
#### <big><big>empty</big></big>
```cpp title="Until C++20"
bool empty() const noexcept;
```
```cpp title="Since C++20"
[[nodiscard]] bool empty() const noexcept;
```
Returns `true` if the node handle is empty, `false` otherwise.

---
#### <big><big>operator bool</big></big>
```cpp
explicit operator bool() const noexcept;
```
Converts to `false` if the node handle is empty, `true` otherwise.

---
#### <big><big>get_allocator</big></big>
```cpp
allocator_type get_allocator() const;
```
Returns a copy of the stored allocator (which is a copy of the allocator of the source container). 
The behavior is undefined if the node handle is empty.
#### Exceptions
Throws nothing.

---
#### <big><big>value</big></big>
```cpp title="set containers only"
value_type& value() const;
```
Returns a reference to the value_type subobject in the container element object managed by this node handle. 
The behavior is undefined if the node handle is empty.
#### Exceptions
Throws nothing.

---
#### <big><big>key</big></big>
```cpp title="map containers only"
key_type& key() const;
```
Returns a non-const reference to the key_type member of the value_type subobject in the container element object managed by this node handle. 
The behavior is undefined if the node handle is empty.
#### Exceptions
Throws nothing.
#### Notes
This function makes it possible to modify the key of a node extracted from a map, and then re-insert it into the map, 
without ever copying or moving the element.

---
#### <big><big>mapped</big></big>
```cpp title="map containers only"
mapped_type& mapped() const;
```
Returns a reference to the mapped_type member of the value_type subobject in the container element object managed by this node handle. The behavior is undefined if the node handle is empty.
#### Exceptions
Throws nothing.

---
#### <big><big>swap</big></big>
```cpp
void swap(/* node-handle */& nh) noexcept(/* see below */);
```
* swaps ownership of container nodes;
* if one node is empty or if both nodes are non-empty and `std::allocator_traits<allocator_type>::propagate_on_container_swap` is true, 
swaps the allocators as well.

The behavior is undefined if both nodes are not empty and `std::allocator_traits<allocator_type>::propagate_on_container_swap` is false 
and the allocators do not compare equal.
#### Exceptions
noexcept specification: 
```cpp 
noexcept(std::allocator_traits<allocator_type>::propagate_on_container_swap::value ||
         std::allocator_traits<allocator_type>::is_always_equal::value)
```

---

### Non-member functions

---
#### <big><big>swap</big></big>
```cpp
friend void swap(/* node-handle */& x, /* node-handle */& y) noexcept(noexcept(x.swap(y)));
```
Effectively executes `x.swap(y)`.

This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified lookup,
and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when node-handle is an associated class of the arguments.
