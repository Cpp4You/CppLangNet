Returns a pointer to the underlying array serving as character storage.

The pointer is such that the range: ** [ data(); data() + size() )** is valid and the values in it correspond to the values stored in the string.

The returned array is not required to be null-terminated.

:::caution
If [`empty()`](empty) returns `true`, the pointer is a non-null pointer that should not be dereferenced.
