# Algorithms

The C++ algorithm library is a collection of functions that are designed to make it easier to write **correct**,
**efficient**, **expressive** and **reusable** code.

It provides a set of common, highly optimized algorithms that can be used to perform a variety of tasks,
such as searching for an item in a list, sorting a collection of data, or manipulating the contents of a container.


One of the main benefits of using the algorithm library is that it allows you to write code that is easier to understand and less error prone.
All the algorithms have **almost universally recognized names** which helps understanding what certain parts of code using them do without having to do a lot of digging.
Because the algorithms from the standard library have been thoroughly **tested** and **optimized**, you can rely on them to work correctly and efficiently.
This can save you time and effort when developing software and it can help to reduce the risk of introducing bugs into your code.


Another benefit of the algorithm library is that it promotes **code reuse**.
By using the algorithms provided by the library, you can avoid having to reimplement common operations, which can save time and make it easier to maintain your code.


Overall, the C++ algorithm library is an important tool for C++ programmers that makes it easier to write **reliable**, **efficient**, and **reusable** code.

# Usage

To use the algorithms you have to include the `<algorithm>` header, like so:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
```

Then you can use them in code:

<SwitchView content={{
	'Rangified version': <Sorting_Example_Rangified/>,
	'Ordinary version': <Sorting_Example_Ordinary/>
}}/>

<details>
<summary>Rangified vs ordinary version</summary>
<div>

As you can see in the example above, there are two versions of algorithms. The **rangified** one and the **ordinary** one.
The rangified version came to C++ with the **C++20** standard. If you have a new enough compiler, you should be able to use it.


The basic difference between the two is that the ordinary version only accepts iterators,
while the rangified version is more convenient and allows one to pass the whole range and enables the use of [projections](#).


The rangified version is also **less error-prone**, as you can't pass invalid iterators by mistake (it also handles a few advanced things better than the ordinary version).


All that being said, using the rangified version is more beneficial and convenient, so if you have a possibility of choosing so, prefer the rangified version.

# Iterators

Iteration is the action of repeating a process, in case of containers, **iteration** means traversing the container in a particular order while obtaining each of it's elements.


Iterators are special objects with [pointer](#) semantics (having semantics of something basically means acting like something,
pointer semantics mean that the iterator objects act like pointers in most ways, they can be dereferenced, incremented, etc.. **Pointers are also valid iterators**),
that are used to iterate over containers (like strings, arrays, maps, sets, etc.).


They are obtained via the `begin()` and `end()` functions, and their variants:

 - `cbegin()`/`cend()` - return a **const iterator** to a container (you cannot change the contents via it)
 - `rbegin()`/`rend()` - return a **reverse iterator** to a container (iteration in reverse order)
 - `crbegin()`/`crend()` - return a **const reverse iterator** to a container (iteration in reverse order and you cannot change the contents via it)


Not every container has all the variations, for example [std::unordered_set](/docs/std/containers/sets/unordered-set) doesn't have the `r` and `cr` versions.


Different iterators have different types and they work a little bit differently, but the most basic things you can do with an iterator is:
 - increment it (`it++` and `++it`), which traverses onto the next object in a container
 - dereference it (`*it`), which returns the value that the iterator points to


 Here are a few examples of using iterators with [std::vector](/docs/std/containers/arrays/vector):


<SwitchView content={{
	'Printing vector': <Iterator_Example_Printing/>,
	'Printing vector in reverse': <Iterator_Example_Printing_Reverse/>,
	'Zeroing vector': <Iterator_Example_Zeroing/>,
}}/>

Now, notice how we had to manually specify the type (`std::vector<int>::iterator`, `std::vector<int>::reverse_iterator`, etc.) every time. It is not very convenient. For that purpose you can use the `auto` placeholder:

```cpp
auto begin = numbers.begin();
```
```cpp
auto begin = numbers.rbegin();
```
```cpp
auto begin = numbers.crbegin();
```

`auto` deduces the type for us and it has no performance penalty. The code is easier to read that way, so if you can, prefer it. Read more about it here: [auto](#).

# Ranges

Now what exactly is a range? The exact definition and inner workings in C++ are a little bit complicated, but a range can be defined as anything that we can iterate over. An array, vector, string, map, etc..

All rangified algorithms accept a range. The same way iterators can be different types and have slightly different behaviours, some ranges also differ from others and cannot be used with some algorithms.
