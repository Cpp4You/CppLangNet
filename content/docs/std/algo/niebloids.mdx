# Niebloids

Niebloids as a concept and pattern existed for a long time, they were first introduced by [**Eric Niebler**](https://ericniebler.com/about/)
in his C++14 [**range-v3**](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3/) library.

The name was suggested by the author himself in a [poll on twitter in 2018](https://twitter.com/tcanens/status/1063723279414890496).

Before getting to niebloids, we first have to have some understanding in the following topics:
- Unqualified lookup / Qualified lookup
- ADL (Argument Dependent Lookup)

We will briefly go over them. You can skip to the last section if these topics are already familiar to you.

## Qualified vs Unqualified Lookup

When we use any kind of an identifier in our code, lookup happens - the compiler tries to determine where the identifier
is from and what it means in our code - is it a class/an object/a function? What type does it have? What namespace is it in? Etc.

We won't delve deeply into the details, because both are pretty complicated, but all we want to know is that
the latter - unqualified lookup - is what we want.

Syntatically, qualified lookup implies the use of [**scope resolution operator**](#) - `::`, that is:

<CustomCodeBlock fullCode={ <FullCode_Qualified_Unqualified_Lookup /> }>

```cpp
{
  // auto value = my_ns::x; // Qualified lookup
  // The above fails, because `x` is not present in my_ns namespace

  // krabby_patty::patty_krabby(mr_krabs::secret_recipe); // Qualified lookup
  // The above fails, because namespaces `krabby_patty` and `mr_krabs` are not present

  std::print("Hello {}!", "World"); // Qualified lookup

  auto value = my_ns::MyEnum::One; // Qualified lookup

  ::printf("Hello %s!", "World"); // Qualified lookup
  // If there's nothing to the left of the scope resolution operator, it's refering to the global namespace
}

Hello hello; // Unqualified lookup to Hello, which is found in global scope

{
  // auto value = x; // Unqualified lookup, no scope resolution operator
  // The above fails, because `x` is nowhere to be found

  // foo(1, 2, 3); // Unqualified lookup, no scope resolution operator
  // The above fails, because `foo` is nowhere to be found

  std::print("{}", hello.world()); // Qualified lookup to `std::print`, unqualified lookup to `hello`, which is found in upper scope
  // Unqualified searches starting from the current scope up

  print_me(my_ns::MyEnum::One);
  // Unqualified lookup to `print_me`, qualified lookup to my_ns::MyEnum::One
  // This works.
  // But wait... print_me is not present in this scope, upper scope, nor global scope,
  // unqualified lookup didn't pick it up, so how does that work??
  // Is it a bug, magic, or maybe... ADL? :P
}
```

</CustomCodeBlock>

Both of these do a little bit different things, but unqualified lookup does one the other doesn't do - **A**rgument **D**ependent **L**ookup.

## Argument Dependent Lookup

Argument Dependent Lookup (also sometimes reffered to as [**Koenig lookup**](https://web.archive.org/web/20180317070215/http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/a-personal-note-about-argument-dependent/232901443))
calling functions from the argument's respective namespaces without qualifying them explicitly.
or ADL for short is a very advanced topic in itself, but in short, what it allows is calling functions without qualifying them
if they are present in the namespace of any of the arguments used.

That sounds pretty complicated, but here's a simple example you've already seen and written a thousand times probably:
```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, world!";
```

Yep. What we see above would not work if it wasn't for ADL. Here's how the code above looks to the compiler:
```cpp
operator<<(std::cout, "Hello, world!");
```

You could even write this code yourself and see that it would compile
(though, of course, no one would write code like this for real, it's not very practical and eliminates the convenience of overloading operators).

Here's the example the previous section about lookup:
<CustomCodeBlock fullCode={ <FullCode_Adl/> }>

```cpp
print_me(my_ns::MyEnum::One);
```

</CustomCodeBlock>

You may be surprised it works - intuiton tells us that it shouldn't, because even tho we have a fully qualified `my_ns::MyEnum::One` which
is resolved via qualified lookup correctly, `print_me` is not qualified and it should not be present in this scope, thus not reachable.

And your intuition would be right.. At least if it wasn't for ADL.

What ADL does is actually very simple\* - when you perform an unqualified call to a function, it looks at the types of
the arguments of the functions and adds all the functions from each namespace the types of the arguments participate in to the resolution set.

That is, when performing Argument Dependent Lookup on this function call:
```cpp
print_me(my_ns::MyEnum::One);
```

We look at the type of the arguments, in this case `my_ns::MyEnum`, and add it's namespace (`my_ns`) to the resolution set.

`my_ns` does indeed contain `print_me` which accepts `MyEnum::One` as an argument, so it's found and later called.

*\* - well, it's actually a more complicated than that and it does a little bit more things, but that's the gist and
that's what's actually important here*

## Unqualified lookup and ADL together

Unqualified Lookup and Argument Dependent Lookup work together, one after another.
The important rule to keep in mind about ADL - it is **not performed** in several different cases after unqualified lookup.

One of these cases that is of interest to us is when unqualified lookup finds a declaration that is
- neither a **function**
- nor a **function template**

```cpp
auto x = 2137;
auto y = x + 1; // unqualified lookup for x, no ADL because x is an object
```

And if you think about it - it makes sense, ADL should only apply to function calls, it doesn't make sense to apply
ADL to an object that was being looked up. An object doesn't accept any parameters that we can examine.

Why am I talking about it? Because it's crucial for understanding Niebloids.

<span class="inline-important">So once again, keep in mind - <b>ADL doesn't happen if unqualified lookup found something that is neither a function nor a function template</b></span>

## Niebloids

Finally, we come to pinnacle of this article - niebloids.

[Cppreference*](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/ranges/all_any_none_of) tells us that the key characteristics of a niebloid are:
- Niebloids inhibit ADL
- <span class="inline-caution">Explicit template arguments cannot be specified</span>**

You may also stumble upon people mentioning, that <span class="inline-danger">even though they are templated, they can be passed to higher order functions without any problem.</span>\*\*\*

<span>*</span> Look at the end of the description of the algorithm, each and every rangified algorithm contains the same definition.

### Implementation

As specified previously, niebloids inhibit (disallow) ADL, that is, when unqualified lookup happens and any of them is found, no ADL is performed.

The are currently only two ways to achieve that.

One of them is to to make them a function object,
as specified in the [Unqualified lookup and ADL together](#unqualified-lookup-and-adl-together) section,
ADL doesn't happen if unqualified lookup happens to find something that is neither a **function**, nor a **function template** - a function object
is none of those, so ADL is disabled.

The other way to implement such behaviour is to use internal compiler extensions, but no known implementation does that currently.

<span>**</span> One of the characteristics specified is not being able to specify explicit template arguments, it is true with
how niebloids are currently implemented by all the major vendors, but keep in mind that it's not a planned feature of niebloids
and just a side effect of niebloids being implemented as function objects. This behaviour may change in the future, if vendors
decide to conjure a special extension for ease of implementation/maintainability.

<br/> <br/>

<span>***</span> People also sometimes mention, that one of the advantages of niebloids over ordinary functions is that you can pass them
to higher order functions (functions taking other functions as arguments, in this context) with no problem.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

template <typename Fun>
auto do_thing(std::vector<int>& ints1, std::vector<int>& ints2, Fun fun)
{
  fun(ints1, ints2);
}

auto main() -> int
{
  auto ints1 = std::vector { 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 };
  auto ints2 = std::vector { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
  do_thing(ints1, ints2, std::ranges::swap); // Would not compile with std::swap
}
```
And while it is true for range-v3, because the key design is to use function objects and have these advantages,
it's not true for `std::` niebloids, the standard doesn't specify they have to be implemented to allow such behaviour.

This means you **should not** rely on this behaviour, because your code may break in the future.

<details>

<summary>Ways to pass such a function to HOF</summary>

If you have a need to pass such a function to some HOF, you can use a lambda that mimics the intended interface:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

template <typename Fun>
auto do_thing(std::vector<int>& ints1, std::vector<int>& ints2, Fun fun)
{
  fun(ints1, ints2);
}

auto main() -> int
{
  auto ints1 = std::vector { 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 };
  auto ints2 = std::vector { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
  do_thing(ints1, ints2, [](auto& a, auto &b) { std::swap(a, b); }); // Compiles, tho requires thinking and typing

  std::cout << ints1[0] << ' ' << ints2[0];
}
```

Or write a very scary looking generic macro which abstracts that away:

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>

#define LIFT_FWD_(...) (static_cast<decltype(__VA_ARGS__)&&>(__VA_ARGS__))
#define LIFT(...) \
  [](auto&&... args) \
    noexcept(noexcept(__VA_ARGS__(LIFT_FWD_(args)...))) \
    -> decltype(__VA_ARGS__(LIFT_FWD_(args)...)) \
    { return __VA_ARGS__(LIFT_FWD_(args)...); }

template <typename Fun>
auto do_thing(std::vector<int>& ints1, std::vector<int>& ints2, Fun fun)
{
  fun(ints1, ints2);
}

auto main() -> int
{
  auto ints1 = std::vector { 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 };
  auto ints2 = std::vector { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
  do_thing(ints1, ints2, LIFT(std::swap)); // Compiles, black boxed magic that just works^tm
}
```

<details>
<summary>Explanation of the above macro</summary>

The above macro is a lot of magic, yes, but it basically handles everything properly and correctly for us.

First we define `LIFT_FWD_` which basically does what [`std::forward`](/docs/std/utility/forward/) does. If you don't know how
it works, follow the above link and read the explanation there.

We define it as a macro, instead of using the function from stdlib directly, because it makes no sense to include the `<utility>` header for our macro.

The lift macro itself can be broken into four parts:
```cpp
[](auto&&... args) // just the starting declaration of a lambda, nothing fancy, we are talking a parameter pack of whatever arguments
noexcept(noexcept(__VA_ARGS__(LIFT_FWD_(args)...))) // we are correctly handling the noexcept case - if our function call is noexcept, our lambda is noexcept as well
-> decltype(__VA_ARGS__(LIFT_FWD_(args)...)) // we are taking the return type of our function call and setting it as our lambda return type
{ return __VA_ARGS__(LIFT_FWD_(args)...); } // the body, actual function call
```

The only confusing part may be `__VA_ARGS__`, why not just `#define LIFT(X) [...] X(LIFT_FWD_(args)...)`?

The answer is - this would work, probably even 99% of the cases, but woud disallow passing in a type with explicit template parameters and a space in it, consider:
```cpp
LIFT(something<int, std::string>)
```

The space in there would make `X` only be `something<int`, so that's just a way to protect against that.

### Reasoning

The whole point of niebloids is to make doing the correct thing easy and convenient, without the programmer having to care
or remember any rules.

By inhibiting (disallowing) ADL, the behaviour of calling an algorithm is consistent with both qualified and unqualified lookup:
```cpp
auto const numbers = std::vector{ 1 ,2, 3, 4, 5 };
{
  auto const min = std::ranges::min(numbers); // Calls std::ranges::min
}

{
  using namespace std::ranges;
  auto const min = min(numbers); // Calls std::ranges::min
}
```

Then, inside, the niebloid does everything correctly. The programmer doesn't have to worry about anything.
