[noexcept](#) specification:
```cpp
noexcept(
  noexcept(swap(*a, *b))
)
```

The lookup for the identifier swap in the exception specification finds this function template in addition to anything found by the usual lookup rules, making the exception specification equivalent to C++17 [`std::is_nothrow_swappable`](#).
