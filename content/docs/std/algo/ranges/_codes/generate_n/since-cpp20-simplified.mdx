```cpp
// (1)
constexpr O generate_n( O first, std::iter_difference_t<O> n, F gen );
```

The type of arguments are generic and have following constraints:
- `O` - `std::input_or_output_iterator`
- `F` - `std::copy_constructible`

Additionally, each overload has the following constraints:
- **(1)** - `invocable<F&> && indirectly_writable<O, invoke_result_t<F&>>`

(The `std::` namespace was ommitted here for readability)
