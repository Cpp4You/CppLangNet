```cpp
// (1)
I uninitialized_fill_n( I first, std::iter_difference_t<I> n, const T& x );
```

The type of arguments are generic and have following constraints:
- `I` - [`no-throw-forward-range`](#)
- `T` - **(none)**

Additionally, each overload has the following constraints:
- **(1)** `std::constructible_from<std::iter_value_t<I>, const T& >`
