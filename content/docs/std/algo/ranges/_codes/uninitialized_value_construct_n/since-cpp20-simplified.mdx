```cpp
// (1)
I uninitialized_value_construct_n( I first, std::iter_difference_t<I> n );
```

The type of arguments are generic and have following constraints:
- `I` - `no-throw-forward-iterator`

Additionally, each overload has the following constraints:
- **(1)** `std::default_initializable<std::iter_value_t<I>>`
