```cpp
// (1)
constexpr I destroy_n( I first, std::iter_difference_t<I> n ) noexcept;
```

The type of arguments are generic and have following constraints:
- `I` - `no-throw-input-iterator`

Additionally, each overload has the following constraints:
- **(1)** `std::destructible<std::iter_value_t<I>>`
