# Preprocessor

The preprocessor is executed at translation phase 4, before the compilation. The result of preprocessing is a single file which is then passed to the actual compiler.

## Directives
The preprocessing directives control the behavior of the preprocessor. Each directive occupies one line and has the following format:

* the <code-d>#</code-d>.
* a sequence of:
    * a standard-defined directive name (listed [below](#capabilities)) followed by the corresponding arguments, or
    * one or more <a href="./translation_phases#phase-3">preprocessing tokens</a> where the beginning token is not a standard-defined directive name, in this case the directive is conditionally-supported with implementation-defined semantics 
    <Until v='cpp23'>(e.g. a common non-standard extension is the directive <code-d>#warning</code-d> which emits a user-defined message during compilation)</Until>, or
    * nothing, in this case the directive has no effect.
* a line break.

<Since v='cpp20'><a href="./modules">The module and import directives</a> are also preprocessing directives.</Since><br/><br/>

```cpp title='Preprocessing directives must not come from macro expansion.'
#define EMPTY
EMPTY   #   include <file.h> // not a preprocessing directive
```

## Capabilities
The preprocessor has the source file translation capabilities:

* <a href="./preprocessor/conditional">conditionally</a> compile parts of source file (controlled by directive <span class='col-d'>#if</span>, <span class='col-d'>#ifdef</span>, <span class='col-d'>#ifndef</span>, 
<span class='col-d'>#else</span>, <span class='col-d'>#elif</span>, <Since v='cpp23'><span class='col-d'>#elifdef</span>, <span class='col-d'>#elifndef</span></Since> , and <span class='col-d'>#endif</span>).
* <a href="./preprocessor/replace">replace</a> text macros while possibly concatenating or quoting identifiers (controlled by directives <span class='col-d'>#define</span> and <span class='col-d'>#undef</span>, and operators <code-d>#</code-d>, <code-d>##</code-d>). <a href="./preprocessor/include">include</a> other files (controlled by directive <span class='col-d'>#include</span> <Since v='cpp17'>and checked with <code>__has_include</code></Since>).
* cause an <a href="./preprocessor/error">error</a> <Since v='cpp23'>or <a href="./preprocessor/error">warning</a></Since> (controlled by directive <span class='col-d'>#error</span> <Since v='cpp23'>or <span class='col-d'>#warning</span> respectively</Since>).

The following aspects of the preprocessor can be controlled:
* <a href="./preprocessor/impl">implementation-defined</a> behavior (controlled by directive <span class='col-d'>#pragma</span> <Since v='cpp11'>and operator <code>_Pragma</code></Since>). 
    In addition, some compilers support (to varying degrees) the operator <code>__pragma</code> as a <i>non-standard</i> extension.
* <a href="./preprocessor/line">file name and line information</a> available to the preprocessor (controlled by directive <span class='col-d'>#line</span>).

### Defect reports
The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
