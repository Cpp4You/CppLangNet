# <Since v='cpp11'><small>C++ named requirements:</small> *BasicLockable*</Since>

The ***BasicLockable*** requirements describe the minimal characteristics of types that provide exclusive blocking semantics for execution agents (i.e. threads).

### Requirements
For type `L` to be *BasicLockable*, the following conditions have to be satisfied for an object `m` of type **L**:

| **Expression** | **Preconditions**                                           | **Effects**                                                                                                                                  |
|:--------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `m.lock()`     |                                                             | Blocks until a lock can be acquired for the current execution agent (thread, process, task). If an exception is thrown, no lock is acquired. |
| `m.unlock()`   | The current execution agent holds a non-shared lock on `m`. | Releases the non-shared lock held by the execution agent. Throws no exceptions.                                                              |

### Non-shared locks
A lock on an object is said to be *non-shared* lock if it is acquired by a call to lock, try_lock, try_lock_for, or try_lock_until member function.
