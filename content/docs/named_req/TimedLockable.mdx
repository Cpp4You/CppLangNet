# <Since v='cpp11'><small>C++ named requirements:</small> *TimedLockable*</Since>

The ***TimedLockable*** requirements describe the characteristics of types that provide timed exclusive blocking semantics for execution agents
(threads, processes, tasks).

### Requirements
* [*Lockable*](/docs/named_req/Lockable)

For type L to be TimedLockable, given
* `rel_time`, a value of a specialization of [std::chrono::duration](/docs/std/chrono/duration), and
* `abs_time`, a value of a specialization of [std::chrono::time_point](/docs/std/chrono/time_point),
the following conditions have to be satisfied for an object `m` of type **L**:

| **Expression**               | **Effects**                                                                              | **Return value**                                    |
|:----------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------:|
| `m.try_lock_for(rel_time)`   | Blocks for the provided duration `rel_time` or until a lock on `m` is acquired.          | <a>true</a> if the lock was acquired, <a>false</a> otherwise. |
| `m.try_lock_until(abs_time)` | Blocks until the provided time point `abs_time` is reached or a lock on `m` is acquired. | <a>true</a> if the lock was acquired, <a>false</a> otherwise. |

### Notes
The try_lock_for and try_lock_until member functions obtain a non-shared lock on m on succcess.
