# <small>C++ named requirements:</small> *ImplicitLifetimeType*
Note: the standard doesn't define a named requirement with this name. This is a type category defined by the core language. 
It is included here as a named requirement only for consistency.

### Requirements
The following types are collectively called *implicit-lifetime types*:

* [scalar types](/docs/named_req/ScalarType)
* [implicit-lifetime class types](/docs/std/language/classes#Implicit-lifetime_class)
* arrays of such types
* cv-qualified versions of these types

### Notes

Certain operations may implicitly create and start the [lifetime](/docs/std/language/lifetime) of objects of implicit-lifetime types, 
if doing so would prevent [undefined behavior](language/ub). 
However, such operations do not start the lifetimes of subobjects of such objects that are not themselves of implicit-lifetime types.

The following operations may implicitly create objects:

* An operation that begins the lifetime of an array of `unsigned char` or <Since v='cpp17'>[std::byte](/docs/std/types/byte)</Since>.
* An invocation of <Since v='cpp17'>[std::aligned_alloc](/docs/std/memory/c/aligned_alloc)</Since>, [std::calloc](/docs/std/memory/c/calloc), 
[std::malloc](/docs/std/memory/c/malloc), or [std::realloc](/docs/std/memory/c/realloc).
* Any implicit or explicit invocation of a function named [operator new](/docs/std/memory/new/operator_new) or [operator new[]]((/docs/std/memory/new/operator_new))
(including non-allocating and user-defined placement allocation functions). Including

    * [std::allocator::allocate](/docs/std/memory/allocator/allocate)
    * <Since v='cpp23'>[std::allocator::allocate_at_least](/docs/std/memory/allocator/allocate_at_least)</Since>
* <Since v='cpp17'> An invocation of <a href="/docs/std/memory/memory_resource/allocate">std::memory_resource::allocate</a>, 
regardless of how storage is obtained. Including </Since>

    * <a href="/docs/std/memory/polymorphic_allocator/allocate">std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator::allocate</a>
    * <Since v='cpp20'><a href="/docs/std/memory/polymorphic_allocator/allocate_bytes">std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator::allocate_bytes</a></Since>
    * <Since v='cpp20'><a href="/docs/std/memory/polymorphic_allocator/allocate_objects">std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator::allocate_objects</a></Since>
* An invocation of [std::memcpy](/docs/std/string/byte/memcpy) or [std::memmove](/docs/std/string/byte/memmove).
* <Since v='cpp20'>An invocation of <a href="/docs/std/numeric/bit_cast">std::bit_cast</a></Since>
* <Since v='cpp23'>An invocation of std::start_lifetime_as or std::start_lifetime_as_array.</Since>
* An assignment expression that involves [union members](/docs/std/language/union#Member_lifetime) if the union's assignment operator is built-in or trivial.
