# <small>C++ named requirements:</small> *UnformattedOutputFunction*

### Requirements
An ***UnformattedOutputFunction*** is a stream output function that performs the following:

* Constructs an object of type [basic_istream::sentry](/docs/std/io/basic_ostream/sentry) 
with automatic storage duration and with the noskipws argument set to <a>true</a>, which performs the following:
    * If [eofbit](/docs/std/io/ios_base/iostate) or [badbit](/docs/std/io/ios_base/iostate) are set on the output stream, sets the failbit as well, 
    and if exceptions on failbit are enabled in this output stream's [exception mask](/docs/std/io/basic_ios/exceptions) `((exceptions() & failbit) != 0)`, 
    throws [ios_base::failure](/docs/std/io/ios_base/failure).
    * Flushes the tie()'d output stream, if applicable.

* Checks the status of the sentry by calling sentry::operator bool(), which is equivalent to [basic_ios::good](/docs/std/io/ios_base/good).
    * If the operator returns `false` or sentry's constructor throws an exception, no output takes place.
    * If the operator returns `true`, attempts to perform the desired output by inserting the characters into the output stream 
    as if by calling `rdbuf()->sputc()`. Other public members of [std::basic_ostream](/docs/std/io/basic_ostream/) may also be used, 
    but virtual members of `rdbuf()` except [overflow()](/docs/std/io/basic_streambuf/overflow), 
    [xsputn()](/docs/std/io/basic_streambuf/xsputn) and [sync()](/docs/std/io/basic_streambuf/sync) will never be called.
        * If an exception is thrown during output, sets badbit in the output stream. If exceptions on badbit are enabled in this stream's 
        [exception mask](/docs/std/io/basic_ios/exceptions) `((exceptions() & failbit) != 0)`, the exception is also rethrown.
        * If no exception was thrown, returns the value specified by the function.

* In any event, whether terminating by exception or returning, the sentry's destructor is called before leaving this function.

### Standard library
The following standard library functions are ***UnformattedOutputFunctions***.

* [basic_ostream::operator&lt;&lt;<small>(basic_streambuf\*)</small>](/docs/std/io/basic_ostream/operator_ltlt)
* [basic_ostream::put](/docs/std/io/basic_ostream/put)
* [basic_ostream::write](/docs/std/io/basic_ostream/write)
* [basic_ostream::flush](/docs/std/io/basic_ostream/flush)
* <Since v='cpp11'><a href="/docs/std/io/basic_ostream/tellp">basic_ostream::tellp</a> (except calls pubseekoff instead of output)</Since>
* <Since v='cpp11'><a href="/docs/std/io/basic_ostream/seekp">basic_ostream::seekp</a> (except calls pubseekoff or pubseekpos instead of output)</Since>


### Defect reports
The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
