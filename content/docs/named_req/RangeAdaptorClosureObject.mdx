Range adaptor closure objects are [*FunctionObjects*](/docs/named_req/FunctionObject) that are callable via the pipe operator: 
if `C` is a [range](/docs/std/ranges/range) adaptor closure object and `R` is a range, these two expressions are [equivalent](/docs/std/language/expressions#Expression-equivalence):

```cpp
C(R)
R | C
```

Two range adaptor closure objects can be chained by `operator|` to produce another range adaptor closure object: 
if `C` and `D` are range adaptor closure objects, then `C | D` produces a range adaptor closure object `E` with the following properties:

* `E` stores a copy of `C` and `D`, direct-non-list-initialized from <code><a href="/docs/std/utility/forward">std::forward</a>&lt;decltype((C))&gt;(C)</code> 
and <code><a href="/docs/std/utility/forward">std::forward</a>&lt;decltype((D))&gt;(D)</code> respectively. 
  If such initialization is invalid, `C | D` is also invalid.
* Let `c` and `d` be the stored copies (with the same constness and value category as `E`), and `R` be a [range](/docs/std/ranges/range) object, 
  the following expressions are [equivalent](/docs/std/language/expressions#Expression-equivalence):

```cpp
d(c(R))
R | c | d
E(R)
R | E // R | (C | D)
```

### Notes 
`operator()` is unsupported for volatile-qualified or const-volatile-qualified version of range adaptor object closure types.

Objects whose type is the same as one of the following objects (ignoring cv-qualification) are range adaptor closure objects:
* unary range adaptor objects,
* <Since v='cpp23'>objects of user-defined types that meet <a href="ranges/range_adaptor_closure">the requirements of implementing a range adaptor closure object</a></Since>,
* the results of binding trailing arguments by range adaptor objects, and
* the results of chaining two range adaptor closure objects by `operator|`.
