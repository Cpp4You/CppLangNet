# <Since v='cpp11'><small>C++ named requirements:</small> *MoveInsertable*</Since>

Specifies that an object of the type can be constructed into uninitialized storage from an rvalue of that type by a given allocator.

### Requirements
The type **T** is *MoveInsertable* into the container **X** whose value_type is identical to **T** if given

* `A` an allocator type
* `m` an lvalue of type `A`
* `p` the pointer of type `T*` prepared by the container
* `rv` rvalue expression of type **T**
where **X::allocator_type** is identical to <code><a href="/docs/std/memory/allocator_traits">std::allocator_traits</a>&lt;A&gt;::rebind_alloc&lt;T&gt;</code>,

the following expression is well-formed:
```cpp
std::allocator_traits<A>::construct(m, p, rv);
```

And after evaluation, the value of `*p` is equivalent to the value of `rv` (`rv` remains valid, but is in an unspecified state.)

If **X** is not allocator-aware or is a [std::basic_string](/docs/std/containers/strings/string) specialization, 
the term is defined as if **A** were [std::allocator](/docs/std/memory/allocator)&lt;T&gt;, 
except that no allocator object needs to be created, and user-defined specializations of [std::allocator](/docs/std/memory/allocator) are not instantiated.

### Notes
If A is [std::allocator](/docs/std/memory/allocator)&lt;T&gt;, then this will call placement-new, 
as by <Until v='cpp20'><code>::new((void*)p) T(rv)</code></Until> <Since v='cpp20'><code><a href="/docs/std/memory/construct_at">std::construct_at</a>(p, rv)</code></Since>
This effectively requires **T** to be move constructible.

If [std::allocator](/docs/std/memory/allocator)&lt;T&gt; or a similar allocator is used, 
a class does not have to implement a move constructor to satisfy this type requirement: 
a copy constructor that takes a const **T&** argument can bind rvalue expressions. 
If a *MoveInsertable* class implements a move constructor, 
it may also implement move semantics to take advantage of the fact that the value of `rv` after construction is unspecified.

Although it is required that customized construct is used when constructing elements of [std::basic_string](/docs/std/containers/strings/string) until C++23, 
all implementations only used the default mechanism. The requirement is corrected 
by [P1072R10](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p1072r10.html) to match existing practice.
