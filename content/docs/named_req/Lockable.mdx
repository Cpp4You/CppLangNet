# <Since v='cpp11'><small>C++ named requirements:</small> *BasicLockable*</Since>

The ***Lockable*** requirements extends the [*BasicLockable*](/docs/named_req/BasicLockable) requirements to include attempted locking.

### Requirements
* [*BasicLockable*](/docs/naamed_req/BasicLockable)

For type **L** to be *Lockable*, it must meet the above condition as well as the following:

|  **Expression**  | **Effects**                                                                                                                                            | **Return value**                                   |
|:----------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------:|
| `m.try_lock()`   | Attempts to acquire the lock for the current execution agent (thread, process, task) without blocking. If an exception is thrown, no lock is obtained. | <a>true</a> if the lock was acquired, <a>false</a> otherwise |

### Notes
The try_lock member functions obtains a non-shared lock on `m` on succcess.
