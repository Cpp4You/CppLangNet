# <small>C++ named requirements:</small> *FormattedInputFunction*

### Requirements
A ***FormattedInputFunction*** is a stream input function that performs the following:

* Constructs an object of type [basic_istream::sentry](/docs/std/io/basic_istream/sentry) 
with automatic storage duration and with the noskipws argument set to `false`, which performs the following:
    * if [eofbit](/docs/std/io/ios_base/iostate) or [badbit](/docs/std/io/ios_base/iostate) are set on the input stream, 
    sets the failbit as well, and if exceptions on failbit are enabled in this input stream's 
    [exception mask](/docs/std/io/basic_ios/exceptions) `((exceptions() & failbit) != 0)`, throws [ios_base::failure](/docs/std/io/ios_base/failure).
    * flushes the tie()'d output stream, if applicable
    * if ios_base::skipws flag is set on this input stream, extracts and discards characters from the input stream until one of the following becomes true:
        * the next available character on the input stream is not a whitespace character, 
        as tested by the [std::ctype](/docs/std/locale/ctype) facet of the locale currently imbued in this input stream. The non-whitespace character is not extracted.
        * the end of the stream is reached, in which case failbit and eofbit are set and if the stream is on for exceptions on one of these bits, 
        [ios_base::failure](/docs/std/io/ios_base/failure) is thrown.
* Checks the status of the sentry by calling sentry::operator bool(), which is equivalent to [basic_ios::good](/docs/std/io/ios_base/good).
* If the sentry returned `false` or sentry's constructor threw an exception, no input takes place
* If the sentry returned <a>true</a>, performs the input as if by calling `rdbuf()->sbumpc()` or `rdbuf()->sgetc()`.
    * if the end of the stream is reached (the call to `rdbuf()->sbumpc()` or `rdbuf()->sgetc()` returns `Traits::eof()`), sets eofbit. 
    If exceptions on eofbit are enabled in this stream's [exception mask](/docs/std/io/basic_ios/exceptions) `((exceptions() & eofbit) != 0)`, 
    throws [ios_base::failure](/docs/std/io/ios_base/failure).
    * if an exception is thrown during input, sets badbit in the input stream. 
    If exceptions on badbit are enabled in this stream's [exception mask](/docs/std/io/basic_ios/exceptions) `((exceptions() & badbit) != 0)`, 
    the exception is also rethrown.
    * If no exception was thrown, returns `*this`.
* In any event, whether terminating by exception or returning, the sentry's destructor is called before leaving this function.

### Standard library
The following standard library functions are FormattedInputFunctions.

* [basic_istream::operator&gt;&gt;<small>(int, long, double, void\*, bool)</small>](/docs/std/io/basic_istream/operator_gtgt)
* [operator&gt;&gt;<small>(std::basic_istream, char&)</small>](/docs/std/io/basic_istream/operator_gtgt2)
* [operator&gt;&gt;<small>(std::basic_istream, char\*)</small>](/docs/std/io/basic_istream/operator_gtgt2)
* [operator&gt;&gt;<small>(std::basic_istream, std::bitset)</small>](/docs/std/io/basic_istream/operator_gtgt2)
* [operator&gt;&gt;<small>(std::basic_istream, std::string)</small>](/docs/std/io/basic_istream/operator_gtgt2)
* operator&gt;&gt;, when called on the return value of [std::get_money](/docs/std/io/manip/get_money)

### Defect reports
The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
