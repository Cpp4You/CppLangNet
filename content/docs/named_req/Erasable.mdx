# <Since v='cpp11'><small>C++ named requirements:</small> *Erasable*</Since>

Specifies that an object of the type can be destroyed by a given [*Allocator*](/docs/named_req/Allocator).

The type **T** is *Erasable* from the container **X** whose value_type is identical to **T** if given

* `A` an allocator type
* `m` an lvalue of type `A`
* `p` the pointer of type `T*` prepared by the container

where **X::allocator_type** is identical to <code><a href="/docs/std/memory/allocator_traits">std::allocator_traits</a>&lt;A&gt;::rebind_alloc&lt;T&gt;</code>,

the following expression is well-formed:
```cpp
std::allocator_traits<A>::destroy(m, p);
```

If **X** is not allocator-aware or is a [std::basic_string](/docs/std/containers/strings/string) specialization, 
the term is defined as if A were [std::allocator](/docs/std/memory/allocator)&lt;T&gt; 
except that no allocator object needs to be created, and user-defined specializations of [std::allocator](/docs/std/memory/allocator) are not instantiated.

### Notes
All [standard library containers](/docs/std/containers) require that their element type satisfies *Erasable*.

&emsp;<br/><Until block v='cpp20'>With the default allocator, this requirement is equivalent to the validity of <code>p->~T()</code>, 
which accepts class types with accessible destructors and all scalar types, but rejects array types, function types, reference types, and void. </Until>
&emsp;<br/><Since block v='cpp20'>With the default allocator, this requirement is equivalent to the validity of <code><a href="/docs/std/memory/destroy_at">std::destroy_at</a>(p)</code>, 
which accepts class types with accessible destructors and all scalar types, as well as arrays thereof.</Since>

Although it is required that customized destroy is used when destroying elements of [std::basic_string](/docs/std/containers/strings/string) until C++23, 
all implementations only used the default mechanism. 
The requirement is corrected by [P1072R10](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p1072r10.html) to match existing practice.
