# <small>C++ named requirements:</small> *UnformattedInputFunction*

### Requirements
An ***UnformattedInputFunction*** is a stream input function that performs the following:

* Constructs an object of type [basic_istream::sentry](/docs/std/io/basic_istream/sentry) 
with automatic storage duration and with the noskipws argument set to <a>true</a>, which performs the following:
    * If [eofbit](/docs/std/io/ios_base/iostate) or [badbit](/docs/std/io/ios_base/iostate) are set on the input stream, sets the failbit as well, 
    and if exceptions on failbit are enabled in this input stream's [exception mask](/docs/std/io/basic_ios/exceptions) `((exceptions() & failbit) != 0)`, 
    throws [ios_base::failure](/docs/std/io/ios_base/failure).
    * Flushes the tie()'d output stream, if applicable.

* Checks the status of the sentry by calling sentry::operator bool(), which is equivalent to [basic_ios::good](/docs/std/io/ios_base/good).
    * If the operator returns `false` or sentry's constructor throws an exception:
        * Sets the number of extracted characters (gcount) in the input stream to zero.
        * If the function was called to write to an array of CharT, writes CharT() (the null character) to the first location of the array.
    * If the operator returns <a>true</a>, performs the input as if by calling `rdbuf()->sbumpc()` or `rdbuf()->sgetc()`.
        * If the end of the stream is reached (the call to `rdbuf()->sbumpc()` or `rdbuf()->sgetc()` returns `Traits::eof()`), sets eofbit. 
        If exceptions on eofbit are enabled in this stream's 
        [exception mask](/docs/std/io/basic_ios/exceptions) `((exceptions() & eofbit) != 0`), throws [ios_base::failure](/docs/std/io/ios_base/failure).
        * If an exception is thrown during input, sets badbit in the input stream. 
        If exceptions on badbit are enabled in this stream's [exception mask](/docs/std/io/basic_ios/exceptions) `((exceptions() & badbit) != 0`), the exception is also rethrown.
            * Exceptions thrown from [basic_ios::clear](/docs/std/io/ios_base/clear) are not caught or rethrown.
        * If no exception was thrown during input, sets the number of extracted characters (gcount) in the input stream.

* In any event, whether terminating by exception or returning, the sentry's destructor is called before leaving this function.

### Standard library

The following standard library functions are ***UnformattedInputFunction***s.

* [std::getline](/docs/std/containers/strings/string#inputoutput), except that it does not modify gcount.
* [basic_istream::operator>>](/docs/std/io/basic_istream/operator_gtgt)<small>(basic_streambuf*)</small>
* [basic_istream::get](/docs/std/io/basic_istream/get)
* [basic_istream::getline](/docs/std/io/basic_istream/getline)
* [basic_istream::ignore](/docs/std/io/basic_istream/ignore)
* [basic_istream::peek](/docs/std/io/basic_istream/peek)
* [basic_istream::read](/docs/std/io/basic_istream/read)
* [basic_istream::readsome](/docs/std/io/basic_istream/readsome)
* [basic_istream::putback](/docs/std/io/basic_istream/putback), except that it first clears eofbit
* [basic_istream::unget](/docs/std/io/basic_istream/unget), except that it first clears eofbit
* [basic_istream::sync](/docs/std/io/basic_istream/sync), except that it does not modify gcount
* [basic_istream::tellg](/docs/std/io/basic_istream/tellg), except that it does not modify gcount
* [basic_istream::seekg](/docs/std/io/basic_istream/seekg), except that it first clears eofbit and does not modify gcount
* [std::ws](/docs/std/io/manip/ws), except that it does not modify gcount

### Defect reports
The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
