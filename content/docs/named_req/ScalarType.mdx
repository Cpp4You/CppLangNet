# <small>C++ named requirements:</small> *ScalarType*
Note: the standard doesn't define a named requirement with this name. This is a type category defined by the core language. 
It is included here as a named requirement only for consistency.

### Requirements
The following types are collectively called scalar types:

* [arithmetic types](/docs/std/language/type)
* [enumeration types](/docs/std/language/enum)
* [pointer types](/docs/std/language/pointer)
* [pointer-to-member types](/docs/std/language/pointer#Pointers_to_members)
* <Since v='cpp11'><a href = "/docs/std/types/nullptr_t">std::nullptr_t</a></Since>
* cv-qualified versions of these types
