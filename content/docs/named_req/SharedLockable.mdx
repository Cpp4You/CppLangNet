The ***SharedLockable*** requirements describe the minimal characteristics of types that provide shared blocking semantics for execution agents (i.e. threads).

### Requirements
For type L to be *SharedLockable*, the following conditions have to be satisfied for an object `m` of type **L**:

| **Expression**        | **Preconditions**                                       | **Effects**                                                                                                                                         | **Return value**                                   |
|:---------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------:|
| `m.lock_shared()`     |                                                         | Blocks until a lock can be obtained for the current execution agent (thread, process, task). If an exception is thrown, no lock is obtained.        |                                                    |
| `m.try_lock_shared()` |                                                         | Attempts to obtain a lock for the current execution agent (thread, process, task) without blocking. If an exception is thrown, no lock is obtained. | <a>true</a> if the lock was obtained, <a>false</a> otherwise |
| `m.unlock_shared()`   | The current execution agent holds a shared lock on `m`. | Releases the shared lock held by the execution agent. Throws no exceptions.                                                                         |                                                    |

### Shared locks
A lock on an object is said to be *shared lock* if it is acquired by a call to lock_shared, try_lock_shared, try_lock_shared_for, or try_lock_shared_until member function.
