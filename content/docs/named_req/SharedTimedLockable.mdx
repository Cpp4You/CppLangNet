# <Since v='cpp14'><small>C++ named requirements:</small> *SharedTimedLockable*</Since>

The ***SharedTimedLockable*** requirements describe the characteristics of types that provide timed shared blocking semantics for execution agents (threads, processes, tasks).

### Requirements
* [*SharedLockable*](/docs/named_req/SharedLockable)

For type `L` to be *SharedTimedLockable*, given
* `rel_time`, a value of a specialization of [std::chrono::duration](/docs/std/chrono/duration), and
* `abs_time`, a value of a specialization of [std::chrono::time_point](/docs/std/chrono/time_point),

the following conditions have to be satisfied for an object `m` of type **L**:

| **Expression**                      | **Requires**                                                                             | **Return value**                                    |
|:-----------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------:|
| `m.try_lock_shared_for(rel_time)`   | Blocks for the provided duration `rel_time` or until a lock on `m` is acquired.          | <a>true</a> if the lock was acquired, <a>false</a> otherwise. |
| `m.try_lock_shared_until(abs_time)` | Blocks until the provided time point `abs_time` is reached or a lock on `m` is acquired. | <a>true</a> if the lock was acquired, <a>false</a> otherwise. |

### Notes
The try_lock_shared_for and try_lock_shared_until member functions obtain a shared lock on `m` on succcess.
