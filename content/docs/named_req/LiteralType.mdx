# <Since v='cpp11'><small>C++ named requirements:</small>*LiteralType*</Since>

Specifies that a type is a literal type. Literal types are the types of [constexpr variables](/docs/std/language/constexpr#constexpr-variable) and they can be constructed, 
manipulated, and returned from [constexpr functions](/docs/std/language/constexpr#constexpr-functions).

Note: the standard doesn't define a named requirement with this name. This is a type category defined by the core language. 
It is included here as a named requirement only for consistency.

### Requirements
A literal type is any of the following:

* <Since v='cpp14'>possibly cv-qualified <code><a>void</a></code> (so that constexpr functions can return void);</Since>
* [scalar type](/docs/std/named_req/ScalarType);
* [refrence type](/docs/std/language/reference);
* an [array](/docs/std/language/array) of literal type;
* possibly cv-qualified class type that has all of the following properties:
    * has a <Until v='cpp20'>trivial</Until> <Since v='cpp20'>constexpr</Since> [destructor](/docs/std/language/destructor),
    * is one of
        * <Since v='cpp17'><a href="/docs/std/language/lambda">a closure type</a></Since>,
        * an [aggregate](/docs/std/language/aggregate_initialization#definitions) union type that
        * has no [variant members](/docs/std/language/union#union-like-classes), or
        * has at least one variant member of non-volatile literal type,
    * a non-union aggregate type, and each of its [anonymous union](/docs/std/language/union#anonymous-unions) members
        * has no [variant members](/docs/std/language/union#union-like-classes), or
        * has at least one variant member of non-volatile literal type,
    * a type with at least one constexpr (possibly template) constructor that is not a copy or move constructor,

### Notes
A type can be literal even if all of its constexpr constructors are deleted, inaccessible, or cannot participate in overload resolution.

```cpp
struct A { constexpr A(int) = delete; char c; };    // A is a literal type
constexpr A v = std::bit_cast<A>('0');              // OK in C++20
                                                    // v has literal type and thus can be constexpr
```

### Example
Literal type that extends string literals:

<Columns spacing = '20px' columns = {['6fr','4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp
#include <cstddef>
#include <iostream>
#include <stdexcept>
 
class conststr // conststr is a literal type
{
    const char* p;
    std::size_t sz;
public:
    template<std::size_t N>
    constexpr conststr(const char(&a)[N]) : p(a), sz(N - 1) {}
 
    constexpr char operator[](std::size_t n) const
    {
        return n < sz ? p[n] : throw std::out_of_range("");
    }
 
    constexpr std::size_t size() const { return sz; }
};
 
constexpr std::size_t count_lower(conststr s)
{
    std::size_t c{};
    for (std::size_t n{}; n != s.size(); ++n)
        if ('a' <= s[n] && s[n] <= 'z')
            ++c;
    return c;
}
 
// An output function that requires a compile-time constant N, for testing
template<int N>
struct constN
{
    constN() { std::cout << N << '\n'; }
};
 
int main()
{
    std::cout << "the number of lowercase letters in \"Hello, world!\" is ";
    constN<count_lower("Hello, world!")>(); // the string literal is implicitly
                                            // converted to conststr
}
```

</div>
<div>

```plaintext title="Result"
the number of lowercase letters in "Hello, world!" is 9
```

</div>
</Columns>
