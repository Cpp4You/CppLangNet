# <Since v='cpp11'><small>C++ named requirements:</small> *EmplaceConstructible*</Since>

Specifies that an object of the type can be constructed from a given set of arguments in uninitialized storage by a given allocator.

### Requirements
The type **T** is *MoveInsertable* into the container **X** whose value_type is identical to **T** from the arguments **args** if given

* `A` an allocator type
* `m` an lvalue of type `A`
* `p` the pointer of type `T*` prepared by the container
* `args` zero or more arguments

where **X::allocator_type** is identical to <code><a href="/docs/std/memory/allocator_traits">std::allocator_traits</a>&lt;A&gt;::rebind_alloc&lt;T&gt;</code>,

the following expression is well-formed:
```cpp
std::allocator_traits<A>::construct(m, p, args);
```

If **X** is not allocator-aware or is a [std::basic_string](/docs/std/containers/strings/string) specialization, 
the term is defined as if A were [std::allocator](/docs/std/memory/allocator)&lt;T&gt;, 
except that no allocator object needs to be created, and user-defined specializations of [std::allocator](/docs/std/memory/allocator) are not instantiated.

### Notes
Although it is required that customized construct is used when constructing elements of [std::basic_string](/docs/std/containers/strings/string) until C++23, 
all implementations only used the default mechanism. 
The requirement is corrected by [P1072R10](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2021/p1072r10.html) to match existing practice.
