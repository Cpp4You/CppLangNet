# <Deprecated v='cpp20'><small>C++ named requirements:</small> *PODType*</Deprecated>

Specifies that the type is POD (Plain Old Data) type. This means the type is compatible with the types used in the C programming language, 
that is, can be exchanged with C libraries directly, in its binary form.

Note: the standard doesn't define a named requirement with this name. This is a type category defined by the core language. 
It is included here as a named requirement only for consistency.
&emsp;<br/><Since v='cpp20'> This type requirement is deprecated in the C++ standard. All of its uses have been replaced by the more refined type requirements, 
such as [TrivialType](/docs/named_req/TrivialType), [ScalarType](/docs/named_req/ScalarType), or [StandardLayoutType](/docs/named_req/StandardLayoutType). </Since>


### Requirements
The following types are collectively called *POD types*:

* [scalar types](/docs/named_req/ScalarType)
* [POD classes](/docs/std/language/classes#POD_class)
* arrays of such types
* cv-qualified versions of these types
