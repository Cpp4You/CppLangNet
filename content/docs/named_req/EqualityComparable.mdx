# <small>C++ named requirements:</small> *EqualityComparable*
The type must work with == operator and the result should have standard semantics.

### Requirements
The type T satisfies EqualityComparable if

Given
* `a`, `b` and `c`, expressions of type `T` <Since v='cpp17'>or `const T`</Since>

The following expressions must be valid and have their specified effects:

| **Expression** |           **Return type**          |                                                                                      **Requirements**                                                                                      |
|:----------:|:------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| `a == b`     | [implicitly convertible](language/implicit_conversion) to bool | Establishes an [equivalence relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivalence_relation), that is, it satisfies the following properties:<br/> \* For all values of `a`, `a == a `yields <a>true</a>.<br/> \* If `a == b`, then `b == a` <br/> \* If `a == b` and `b == c`, then `a == c` |

### Notes

To satisfy this requirement, types that do not have built-in [comparison operators](/docs/std/language/operator_comparison) 
have to provide a [user-defined operator==](/docs/std/language/operators).

For the types that are both *EqualityComparable* and [*LessThanComparable*](/docs/named_req/LessThanComparable), 
the C++ standard library makes a distinction between equality, which is the value of the expression `a == b` and equivalence, 
which is the value of the expression `!(a < b) && !(b < a)`.

### Defect reports
The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
