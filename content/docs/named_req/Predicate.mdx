# <small>C++ named requirements:</small> *Predicate*

The ***Predicate*** requirements describe a callable that returns a value testable as a `bool`.

Predicate is typically used with algorithms that take input data (individual objects/containers) and a predicate, 
which is then called on input data to decide on further course of action. Some examples of predicate usage in C++ standard library are:

* [`std::all_of`](/docs/std/algorithm/all_any_none_of), [`std::any_of`](/docs/std/algorithm/all_any_none_of), [`std::none_of`](/docs/std/algorithm/all_any_none_of) 
Take an array of elements and a predicate as an input. Call predicate on individual input elements, and return true if for all/any/none elements, predicate returns true.

* [`std::find_if`](/docs/std/algorithm/find) Take sequence of elements, and a predicate. 
Return first element in the sequence, for which predicate returns value equal to <a>true</a>

<small><small><small> Description of algorithm facilities, given above, is crude and intended to explain Predicate in simple terms. For detailed info, refer to individual pages. </small></small></small>

In other words, if an algorithm takes a *Predicate* `pred` and an iterator `first`, 
it should be able to test the object of the type pointed to by the iterator `first` using the given predicate via a construct like `if(pred(*first)) {...}`.

The function object `pred` shall not apply any non-constant function through the dereferenced iterator <Since v='cpp20'> and must accept a const object argument, 
with the same behavior regardless of whether its argument is const or non-const </Since>. 
This function object may be a pointer to function or an object of a type with an appropriate function call operator.
