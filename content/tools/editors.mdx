# Choose an editor/IDE

If you are a novice developer, start with **an online IDE**.
At the beginning of learning, you should not worry about setting up the tools, but just learning the language itself.
For the first few lessons, use the online environment that will do all the setup for you.
You will also not need to download or manually configure the compiler.
Only when you decide that you want the environment on your computer, go to the [Available IDEs](#available-ides) section.

## Online IDEs

At the moment, we definitely recommend the website: [**Replit.com**](https://replit.com).  
After logging in, you will be able to use their tools **for free**.
See also the article [Creating a C++ project with Repl.it](./online/create-project-with-repl-it).

<ToolCard toolId="replit" setupLink="../online/replit">
	An online environment where you can jump right to learning without having to worry about setup.
	It has an <b>interactive console</b> that gives you a similar experience
	to an environment installed locally on the computer.

## Available IDEs

If you want to have your own IDE on your computer, there is nothing to stop you.
Below you will find a list of IDEs divided into recommended and not recommended, and a brief explanation.

You also run the risk of using C++ incorrectly, as well as
unnecessary headaches and wasting valuable time.
:::

<ToolCard toolId="codeblocks">
	An easy-to-set-up environment with basic code editing tools.
	Some of the most basic features are missing, such as dark theme
	or syntax highlighting as you type.
	The syntax coloring occurs only in the basic form.
</ToolCard>

<ToolCard toolId="cppbuilder">
	An environment mainly intended for creating window applications.
	It has lagged behind current technologies for years, is very unintuitive for beginners,
	and promotes the incorrect use of C++.
</ToolCard>

<ToolCard toolId="devcpp">
	An easy-to-configure environment that has not been actively developed in over 10 years.
	The most basic tools are missing.
</ToolCard>
