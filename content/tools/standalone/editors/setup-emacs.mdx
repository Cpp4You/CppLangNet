# Emacs setup

In this article, we will discuss how to setup Emacs for C++ development on Linux easily.

## Introduction

Emacs is one of the oldest and most versatile text editors available for Linux and
UNIX-based systems. It’s been around for a long time (more than twenty years for GNU Emacs)
and is well known for its powerful and rich editing features. Emacs is also more than just
a text editor; it can be customized and extended with different “modes”, enabling it to be
used like an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for programming languages like C++, Java,
C or Python.

In this article, we will be configuring `lsp-mode` (Language Server Protocol) of emacs for
C++ development. It is advised to learn the basic keybinds like saving a file, searching a file,
searching in a file, etc of Emacs before starting using it.

:::important Note
This article for setting up Emacs is dedicated to novice programmers who want to do C++ development
in Emacs. After configuring Emacs according to this article, user will be able to get basic
functionality like Code-Completion, Real-time Syntax checking, Code Navigation etc.
For advance configuration of `lsp-mode` for C++ development, refer [here](https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/tutorials/CPP-guide/)
:::


## Downloading and Installing

We will be installing Emacs from terminal in Linux.

First, we have to open up the terminal; we can use the shortcut
`Ctrl` + `Alt` + `t` or we can manually open it up by searching it in
the menu

**Command 1:** To begin, update the packages list using the below command
```
sudo apt-get update
```
This command is used to download package information from all configured
sources and to get the info of the updated versions of the packages.

:::important Note
**sudo** *(Super User DO)* enables a permitted user to run a command as
the *superuser* or another user, depending on the security policy. So,
if required, enter your system password to proceed.
:::

**Command 2:** Now we will download Emacs by the following command
```
sudo apt-get install emacs
```
If required enter your system *password* to proceed.
After download, you can check if Emacs is successfully installed in your
system
```
emacs --version
```
If installed successfully, output would be like this

**Output:**

<Image center
       alt="Output for `emacs --version`"
       src="/img/tutorials/tools/emacs-version.jpg"
    />


```
Now we're good to customize Emacs, just open the *initialization* file of Emacs
cd ~/.emacs.d && emacs init.el
```
All the customizing code for Emacs will be written in `init.el` file.

:::important Note
Every time when it is mentioned here to save the file, it is meant to execute
`C-x``C-s` (`Control + x`, then `Control + s`) keybind and every time when it is
mentioned here to execute the latest command/code from Emacs, it is meant to
execute `C-x``C-e` (`Control + x`, then `Control + e`) with cursor at the very end of the command/code.

## Setting up MELPA and `use-package`

### Setting up MELPA
MELPA (Milkypostman's Emacs Lisp Package Archive) is an ELPA-compatible package repository
that contains an enormous amount of useful Emacs packages.
Add the following code and execute it in order to download other packages required to configure
Emacs for C++ Development.

```lisp title="init.el"
(require 'package)
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
	     '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
	     '("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/"))
(package-initialize)
```
After executing the above lines of code, 5000+ packages will be available to you for downloading
inside Emacs. You can see them by running following command
```
M-x package-list-packages RET
```

**Output:**
<Image center
       alt="List of packages in Emacs"
       src="/img/tutorials/tools/package-list.jpg"
    />


### Setting up `use-package`

Add following code in `init.el` and execute it.
```lisp title="init.el"
(unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-install 'use-package))
```
Now we will be using `use-package` to download and install any other package for Emacs. `use-package`
is a very popular package to organize the Emacs configuration and load the installed packages efficiently.


Copy the following code inside the `inti.el` file for downloading and installing the required packages for
C++ development inside Emacs.
```lisp title="init.el"
(use-package lsp-mode
  :ensure t
  :hook ((lsp-mode . lsp-enable-which-key-integration))
  :config (setq lsp-completion-enable-additional-text-edit nil))
(use-package lsp-ui
  :commands lsp-ui-mode
  :ensure t)
(use-package ccls
  :ensure t
  :config
  (setq ccls-executable "ccls")
  (setq lsp-prefer-flymake nil)
  (setq-default flycheck-disabled-checkers '(c/c++-clang c/c++-cppcheck c/c++-gcc))
  :hook ((c-mode c++-mode objc-mode) .
         (lambda () (require 'ccls) (lsp))))
(use-package flycheck
  :ensure t)
(use-package yasnippet
  :ensure t
  :config (yas-global-mode))
(use-package which-key
  :ensure t
  :config (which-key-mode))
(use-package helm-lsp
  :ensure t)
(use-package helm
  :ensure t
  :config (helm-mode))
(use-package lsp-treemacs
  :ensure t)

;;; This will enable Emacs to compile a simple cpp single file without any makefile by just pressing [f9] key
(defun code-compile()
  (interactive)
  (unless (file-exists-p "Makefile")
    (set (make-local-variable 'compile-command)
	 (let ((file (file-name-nondirectory buffer-file-name)))
	   (format "%s -o %s %s"
		   (if (equal (file-name-extension file) "cpp") "g++" "gcc")
		   (file-name-sans-extension file)
		   file)))
    (compile compile-command)))
(global-set-key [f9] 'code-compile)
```
For properly indenting the whole file hit `C-x h`, this will select whole file and then hit `TAB`.
Now save the file and exit the Emacs (`C-x C-c`).


Now make a `.cpp` file (like `a.cpp` but not in `.emacs.d/` directory). I recommend to create a directory
dedicated to programming only and there create the file. First on opening the Emacs, many packages will get
downloaded and get installed which can take some time. After that, `lsp-mode` will seek the language server
for cpp development and since this is the first time startup of the Emacs after `lsp-mode` installation,
it will ask to download the required language server for cpp, that is, `clangd`. Below is the snapshot of
Emacs asking to download `clangd` server.

<Image center
       alt="Prompt for downloading clangd inside Emacs"
       src="/img/tutorials/tools/emacs-clangd-server.jpg"
    />


After downloading `clangd` server, run treemacs command by entering minibuffer (`M-x treemacs`)
(`M-x` means `Alt + x` or `ESC + x`).

When the command is run from minibuffer, output would be like this:-

**Output:**
<Image center
       alt="Before initializing treemacs"
       src="/img/tutorials/tools/before-treemacs-init.jpg"
    />


Select the required directory from the provided options. In my case, my directory name is `Coding/` which
contains `Java/` and `SFML/` as sub directories. After selecting the rightful directory, output would be
like this:-

**Output:**
<Image center
       alt="After initializing treemacs"
       src="/img/tutorials/tools/after-treemacs-init.jpg"
    />


Now let us make our first program by selecting the `a.cpp` buffer
```cpp title="a.cpp"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
	std::cout << "Wassup World\n";
	
	return 0;
}
```

We had already defined a function in our `init.el` file for compiling a simple cpp file by pressing `[f9]`
key (See function `code-compile()` in the last of `init.el` file). So by pressing `[f9]` key, this
simple code will get compiled without exiting Emacs.

**Output:**
<Image center
       alt="Compiling Code by hitting [f9] key"
       src="/img/tutorials/tools/emacs-compile.jpg"
    />


We can run the program inside the Emacs from Emacs shell, also known as `eshell`.
Hit `C-x o` to change buffer, then hit `C-x 2` to split the current buffer into two buffers
and then again hit `C-x o` to change buffer. Changing the buffer can also be done by selecting 
the buffer by mouse until you are using the GUI version of Emacs. Now for starting `eshell`, run
`eshell` command from minibuffer (`M-x eshell`). Once the `eshell` is opened run your executable
file.

**Output:**
<Image center
       alt="Compiling Code by hitting [f9] key"
       src="/img/tutorials/tools/emacs-eshell.jpg"
    />


This is the basic guide for setting up Emacs for CPP development. For enabling and discovering
more features of `lsp-mode` refer [here](https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/tutorials/CPP-guide/).


## General Customization of Emacs

:::important Note
This section is completely ***optional***. This section doesn't contribute towards
C++ development. In this section, we will just configuring looks of Emacs.
:::


When Emacs is opened, it generally start with a startup message. If you want to disable it,
enter this in your `init.el` file
```lisp title="init.el"
(setq inhibit-startup-message t)
```


For making scroll bar invisible
```lisp title="init.el"
(toggle-scroll-bar -1)
```
Save the file and execute this line.
For making it visible again, just replace `-1` with `t`.


For making menu bar invisible
```lisp title="init.el"
(menu-bar-mode -1)
```
Save the file and execute this line.
For making it visible again, just replace `-1` with `t`.


For making tool bar invisible
```lisp title="init.el"
(tool-bar-mode -1)
```
Save the file and execute this line.
For making it visible again, just replace `-1` with `t`.


For making line number visible in front of every new line
```lisp title="init.el"
(global-linum-mode t)
```
Save the file and execute this line.
For making it invisible again, just replace `t` with `-1`.


Emacs also provides variety of built-in themes. User can see and enable the theme which suites them the most.
For viewing the built-in themes, run command `M-x customize-themes` from minibuffer and select the required
theme. Emacs used in the snapshots provided in this guide uses material theme which can be downloaded by
using `use-package`.
```lisp title="init.el"
(use-package material-theme
  :ensure t)
(load-theme 'material t)
```

Restart the Emacs and the material theme will be loaded.
