# GCC setup on Linux

In this article, we will discuss how to setup GCC on linux using terminal.

GCC stands for GNU Compiler Collections which is used to compile mainly
C and C++ language. GCC was originally written as the compiler for the
GNU operating system. GCC is an open-source collection of compilers and
libraries.

First, we have to open up the terminal; we can use the shortcut
`ctrl` + `alt` + `t` or we can manually open it up by searching it in
the menu

**Command 1:** To begin, update the packages list using the below command
```
sudo apt-get update
```
This command is used to download package information from all configured
sources and to get the info of the updated versions of the packages.

:::important Note
***sudo** *(Super User DO)* enables a permitted user to run a command as
the *superuser* or another user, depending on the security policy. So,
if required, enter your system *password* to proceed.
:::

**Command 2:** Now we have to install the build-essential packages, which
is also known as a meta-package, it contains the GCC compiler all the other
essentials used to compile the software written in C and C++ language.
```
sudo apt-get install build-packages
```
If required enter your system *password* to proceed.

**Command 3:** For checking if GCC had successfully installed on your system.
```
gcc --version
```
If installed successfully, output would be like this:
