# Clang setup on Linux

In this article, we will discuss how to setup Clang on Linux easily.

## Introduction

The Clang tool is a front end compiler that is used to compile programming languages
such as C++, C, Objective C++ and Objective C into machine code.

Clang is also used as a compiler for frameworks like OpenMP, OpenCL, RenderScript,
CUDA and HIP. Clang uses the LLVM compiler as its back end and it has been included
in the release of the LLVM since the LLVM 2.6.

## Downloading and installing

We will be installing Clang from terminal in Linux.

First, we have to open up the terminal; we can use the shortcut
`Ctrl` + `Alt` + `t` or we can manually open it up by searching it in
the menu

**Command 1:** To begin, update the packages list using the below command
```
sudo apt-get update
```
This command is used to download package information from all configured
sources and to get the info of the updated versions of the packages.

:::important Note
**sudo** *(Super User DO)* enables a permitted user to run a command as
the *superuser* or another user, depending on the security policy. So,
if required, enter your system password to proceed.
:::

**Command 2:** Now we will download Clang by the following command
```
sudo apt-get install clang
```
If required enter your system *password* to proceed.

<Image center
       alt="Output for `sudo apt-get install clang`"
       src="/img/tutorials/tools/clang-install.jpg"
    />

**Command 3:** After download, check if Clang had successfully installed on your system.
```
clang --version
```
If installed successfully, output would be like this:

**Output:**

<Image center
       alt="Output for `clang --version`"
       src="/img/tutorials/tools/clang-version-output.jpg"
    />

## Uninstalling

**Command:** If you want to uninstall Clang, due to any reason, run the following command
```
sudo apt remove clang && sudo apt autoremove
```
If required enter your system *password* to proceed.

**Output:**

<Image center
       alt="Output for `sudo apt remove clang &amp;&amp; sudo apt autoremove`"
       src="/img/tutorials/tools/clang-remove-output.jpg"
    />
