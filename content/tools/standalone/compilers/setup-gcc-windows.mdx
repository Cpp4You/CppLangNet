In this article, we will show you how to install one of the <u>latest versions</u>
of the **GCC** compiler that will allow you to create programs in C++.

On Windows, the GCC compiler is part of the **MSYS2** package.
You can download it from this page:

<big>


[https://msys2.org](https://msys2.org#installation)


</big>

## Installation and setup

The steps described below are also on their main page.

### 1. Install MSYS2

Just click forward through their installer.

<Image center

		alt="MSYS2 installer - path"
		src="https://www.msys2.org/images/install-2-path.png"
	/>

:::danger Installation path
Remember to install `msys2` in the disk space,
that have no special characters or spaces in the path,
preferably:

```sh title="âœ” Correct path"
C:\msys64
```

or on another disk in a similar location.
:::

### 2. Download appropriate packages

After installation, start the MSYS2 console through the start bar menu for the phrase `MSYS2 MSYS`.

<Image center
		desc="Preview"
		alt="Launching the MSYS2 console"
		src="/img/tutorials/tools/msys2/run-msys2-pl.png"
	/>

Enter the following commands on it:


```sh title="1. Updating the package database"
pacman -Syu
```

When the following information appears in the console:
> ```
> :: Proceed with installation? [Y/n]
> ```

Enter `Y` and accept with Return/Enter key.

Then type `Y` again when this information appears:

> ```
> :: To complete this update all MSYS2 processes including this terminal will be closed. Confirm to proceed [Y/n]`
> ```

**Please reopen the `MSYS2 MSYS` console**

```sh title="2. Base packages update"
pacman -Su
```

Again, the question we confirm with `Y`:

> ```
> :: Proceed with installation? [Y/n]
> ```

And we enter the command that will allow us to install MinGW-w64

```sh title="3. Installing MinGW-w64 packages"
pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
```

When the information pops up:

> ```
> Enter a selection (default=all): 
> ```

Enter the numbers of the packages marked in green:

<Image center
		desc="Preview"
		alt="Selecting MinGW64 packages"
		src="/img/tutorials/tools/msys2/mingw-packages.png"
	/>

In my case:

```sh title="4. Installed package numbers"
1 2 3 7 9 10 11 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
```

:::important Alternatively

You can also install all packages by just pressing Enter,
however, then it will take up a little more disk space.

:::

### 3. Add path to system variable `PATH`

If you have followed the steps above correctly,
you already have the GCC compiler installed on your computer.

To be able to use it efficiently, you also need to add the path
to the `msys64 \ mingw64 \ bin` folder to the system environment
variable named` PATH`.

If you chose the default installation path (`C:\msys64`),
this path will look like this:

```
C:\msys64\mingw64\bin
```

:::tip Instruction

## Test if it works

:::important

The next steps are **optional**.

:::

Finally, it's a good idea to test if the compiler works.

Create an empty folder, e.g. on the desktop and create a file using a code editor or even Notepad,
with the name and extension:

`Main.cpp`

Save the following code in it (you can copy from the site):

```cpp title="Main.cpp - C++20 support checking code"
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <algorithm>
#include <array>
namespace rg = std::ranges;

int main() {
	auto arr = std::to_array({12, 8, 3, 7});

	rg::sort(arr);
	for (size_t i = 0; i < arr.size(); ++i)
	{
		if (i != 0) std::cout << ", ";
		std::cout << arr[i];
	}
}
```

Then run the console in the folder with the file `Main.cpp`,
eg by using the shortcut `Shift + PPM` in the middle of the folder
and pressing "Open the Powershell window here".

Enter the following command:

```sh title="Compile & run command"
g++ Main.cpp -std=c++20 && .\a
```

After a while, the following effect should appear in the console:

```sh title="âœ” Correct result"
3, 7, 8, 13
```

Good luck with your programming ðŸ˜€
