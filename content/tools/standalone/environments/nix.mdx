# Using C and C++ with Nix

When it comes to using C++ with Nix, one may want to do several things:
1. Create a development shell with tools and libraries which is then used in the development loop
2. Package a new/existing project for other Nix and non-Nix users to use
3. Contribute to nixpkgs, so that the packaged project is readily available from the centralized repository
4. Create a CI/CD environment to evaluate the correctness of the project

This series of articles explains all of these in detail, with focus on good practices.

On top of that, we will show how to achieve each of those with flake and non-flake configurations and
how the code may differ when contributed to nixpkgs.

:::caution
This series is **not** by any means a Nix tutorial, each section assumes the reader has a certain knowledge 
acquired beforehand. We will be explaining some patterns and concepts, but you won't probably wont understand
much without having some decent understanding.

If you are unsure about your Nix basics this is what I would recommend:

1. Get familiar with the Nix language first:
    - https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/nix/
    - https://nix.dev/tutorials/nix-language#reading-nix-language
    - https://nixcloud.io/tour/?id=introduction/nix

2. Go through nix.dev to have a better grasp about Nix concepts and good practices:
    - https://nix.dev

3. You may want to read up on flakes as well, as they are ubiquitous in the community:
    - https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes
    - https://nix.dev/concepts/flakes.html
    - https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-05-25-flakes/
    - https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/11/11/notes-on-nix-flakes/

4. For lower level knowledge, go through Nix pills:

5. Toy with and explore the ecosystem - most knowledge is gained through first-hand experience.
