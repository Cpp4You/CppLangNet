# Development tools 🛠

To program in C++ you need at least two tools:

- [a code editor](./editors)
- [a compiler](./compilers)

The combination of these two things into one tool is called **an IDE** (integrated development environment).

## Code editors

A **code editor** allow you to... edit the program code, manage the structure of files in the project
and usually has many other useful functions as well

A summary of the available editors can be found in [**Choose an editor**](./editors).

:::note
There you will also find environments with a built-in compiler (eg. Microsoft Visual Studio).

## Compilers

A **compiler** translates program code into a computer-understandable format <u>only</u> if the code is valid
ie. written according to the C++ language syntax

For a summary of the available compilers, see [**Choose a compiler**](./compilers).
