# Using Replit.com

[**Replit**](https://replit.com) is a very accessible online environment that allows you to create
applications in C++. An important advantage is that it has an interactive console.

## Creating an account

For some time now, Replit.com has required the creation of a free account on their site.
You can do this by following this link: [https://replit.com/signup](https://replit.com/signup)

Then complete the information below:

<Image center
		alt="Creating a Replit account"
		src="/img/tutorials/tools/replit/sign-up-form.png"
	/>

## Creating a project

Once you are logged in, use the C++ application pattern we have prepared by going to this link:

[Replit C++20 Project Template](https://replit.com/@poetakodu/Project-Using-C20?v=1)

Click **Fork repl**:

<Image center
		alt="Creating a new project from template"
		src="/img/tutorials/tools/replit/fork.png"
	/>

:::note
You can also create a default C++ project that the Replit website offers,
but at the moment only Clang 7 will be available, which **does not support C++20**.
:::

## Using the editor

Once you have created your project, you will be transferred to the code editing mode:

<Image center
		alt="C++ code editor"
		src="/img/tutorials/tools/replit/editor-view.png"
	/>
<br/>

The main view is made up of three panels:

Panel | Contents
---------|----------
 Left | tools view, by default **file view** üóÉ
 Middle | **code editor** ‚úè
 Right | **console** üñ• and system terminal (*shell*)

### Running the program

‚ñ∂ At the top you will find the **Run** button that starts the application.

<Image center
		alt		="Run button"
		src		="/img/tutorials/tools/replit/run-button.png"
	/>
<br/>

Before the program can be executed, its code must be compiled. This means that at the beginning
you will see a command to compile the code in the console.

- ‚úî If the program code is correct, the line below will show the result of its operation.
- ‚ö† If the compiler detects any non-fatal problems on the code, it will warn you before running the program.
- üî¥ If the code contains errors, the program will not be compiled or executed.

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="ok" label="‚úî Correct code" default>
		<Image center
				alt		="Compilation and running a valid code"
				src		="/img/tutorials/tools/replit/run-command-ok.png"
				desc	="üü° Compile command, üü£ Result"
			/>
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="warning" label="‚ö† With a warning">
		<Image center
				alt		="Compilation and running a code with warnings"
				desc	="üü° Compile command, üü§ Warning, üü£ Result"
				src		="/img/tutorials/tools/replit/run-command-warning.png"
			/>
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="error" label="üî¥ With an error">
		<Image center
				alt		="Compilation failed because of an error"
				desc	="üü° Compile command, üî¥ Error"
				src		="/img/tutorials/tools/replit/run-command-error.png"
			/>
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Editing the source code

<ImproveSection />

This environment supports all the basic functions that a beginner needs.

### Keyboard shortcuts

Replit is based on the same editor as Visual Studio Code, and therefore has similar keyboard shortcuts.
In addition to the standard ones, it's worth testing these:

Shortcut | Description
---------|----------
`Ctrl + Shift + P` or `F1`					| Open a command window
Drag with middle mouse button				| Place multiple cursors on adjacent lines
`Alt + LPM`									| Add a new cursor at the click location
`Ctrl + /`									| Toggles comment on the selected fragment
`Alt + üîº`									| Move the current line up one line
`Alt + üîΩ`									| Move the current line down one line
`Shift + Alt + üîº`							| Duplicates the selected lines upwards
`Shift + Alt + üîΩ`							| Duplicates the selected lines downwards
