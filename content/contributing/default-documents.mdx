# Default documents

When creating a new folder, for example:

```
/docs/std/math
```

you'll have to create a **default document** named `index.mdx` inside that directory.
This document will be then loaded when you visit [https://cpp-lang.net/docs/std/math/](https://cpp-lang.net/docs/std/math/)
You have to add a following metadata to the top of the `index.mdx` document:

```mdx
---
sidebar_position: 1
slug: /std/math
---
```

:::caution
Make sure that you added slash at the beginning!  
Notice that we **intentionally** omitted the `docs` from the `slug` (do the same when editing other categories - learn, community, tools, etc.).
