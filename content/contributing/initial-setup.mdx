# Initial setup

## Prerequisites

Simple changes, like fixing typos can be done directly in the GitHub file editor. However, for more significant
changes, it is necessary to fork the repository and work on it locally on your computer.
This way, you will be able to preview the changes in real-time before submitting them.
It allows you to make sure that your contributions align with the goals and formatting of the project.

## Creating your local copy of the site

Make sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.

Once you've forked and cloned the repo, run following commands:

```bash title="ðŸ”¹ Performing a clean install"
npm ci
```

To start a site in the default locale (English):
```bash
npm start
```

To start a site in an other locale, for example Polish (notice the double dash in between):

```bash
npm start -- --locale pl
```

## Visual Studio Code setup

If you use VS Code, copy the folder named `.vscode-template` and rename it to `.vscode`.
It contains useful snippets and a configuration for an addon, that you might want to use:
