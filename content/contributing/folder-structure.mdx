# Folder structure

## Source code

The site source code, that is edited by programmers
is located inside `src/` directory. It contains pages
and useful components that we can later use in articles, docs, etc.

## Site docs

Every doc, article and course lesson is located
inside `content/` subdirectory. Those are original articles,
written in English. They should be treated as a reference
when creating translations.

If you want to create a doc in other language, you'll
have to provide an english version of it. Don't worry,
we will help you with that when you'll create a pull request.

## Blog posts

Every blog post is located inside `content/blog/` subdirectory.
Adding blog posts is restricted. Only site maintainer
is allowed to create blog posts.

## Translated docs

There is `i18n` subdirectory (i18n - internationalization).
Inside that, there's a folder for each locale.

Right now we support the following locales:
- **en** - English language  
**Note**: this directory contains only a localized version of
template Markdown files (that can be later reused, imported across other MDX documents).
- **pl** - Polish language

Each language has the following folders inside.

- `blog` - translated blog posts
- `docs` - translated C++ docs that reflect the `/content/docs/` folder.
- `community` - translated C++ feature docs that reflect the `/content/community/` folder
- `learn` - translated C++ course docs that reflect the `/content/learn/` folder
- `tools` - translated C++ tool docs that reflect the `/content/tools/` folder
- `contributing` - translated docs that reflect the `/content/contributing/` folder
- `presets` - translated versions of preset Markdown files, that can be later reused in other Markdown documents.

:::caution
There are also other folders, like `docusaurus-plugin-content-docs-community` but you should ignore them.
Use the convinient shortcuts listed above.
