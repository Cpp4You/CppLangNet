# New documents

import ImproveSection from "@site/i18n/en/presets/ImproveSection.mdx";

:::tip

Its highly recommended for you to first view many of already existing docs, to
learn by example.

:::

If you want to create a new document, please first visit our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/3MeXQ8TvBw),
then ask if there's a need for such an article, or if the course edit would be reasonable.
You can do that or create an issue directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/Cpp4You/CppLangNet/issues), however the communication is
easier and faster on the Discord server.

## Overview

:::note
Visit [this link](https://docusaurus.io/docs/create-doc) to learn how to create docs in Docusaurus.
:::

Let's say that you want to write a lesson (within the course) about class constructors.

First, you have to create an English version of the document, even if you want to write in other language.
This is because it's our *fallback language*, therefore all locales that doesn't provide translation for
certain documents will fallback to the English one.
**Pick a lowercase name without spaces, separated by hyphens**, for example:

```
class-constructors.mdx
```

Since we already have a `classes` directory, we can skip the `class-` prefix, and finally end up with:

```
classes/constructors.mdx
```

### Document metadata

You'll have to fill the [metadata of the document](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs#markdown-frontmatter).
Open it, and at the very top create a **document metadata section**.

```md
---
sidebar_label:		"1. Class constructors"
title:				"Class constructors"
description:		"Lesson: basics of class constructors in C++ language"
tags:				[class, constructor, method, object, object-oriented-programming, object-oriented, oop]
hide_title:			true
---
```

:::caution Legacy field
The `sidebar_position` field was mandatory, but it's not used now. Feel free to remove it from documents that
still contain it. The position is now strictly managed through order in `/sidebars/<section>.js` file.
:::

:::danger
`hide_title: true` should be only used when there is something between metadata and the Markdown H1 heading,
for example:

```md
---
...
hide_title:			true
---

<!-- Components -->
import Columns			from "@site-comps/Columns";

<!-- Presets -->
import NotFinished		from "@site/i18n/en/presetsNotFinished";

# The title of the document
```

Do not use it if metadata is directly above `# The title of the document`, because
Docusaurus will generate an additional H1 heading.

For complete metadata list, please visit [this page](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs#markdown-frontmatter).

### Adding to the sidebar

Your document won't be visible in the sidebar at first. Navigate to the `/sidebars` directory,
and find appropriate file (`learn.js` for [Learn](https://cpp-lang.net/learn/) section, `tools.js` for [Tools](https://cpp-lang.net/tools/) section, etc.)
then add `constructors` to the list.

Sidebars are configured using JavaScript, but most of the their configuration is done with simple
arrays and objects so it will be easy for you to use, even if you don't know the language.
The document we created should be added to the sidebar like this:

```js
// ...
{
	type: 'category',
	label: '9. Classes',
	items: [
		'course/intermediate/classes/intro',
		// highlight-next-line
		'course/intermediate/classes/constructors',
		'course/intermediate/classes/destructors',
		// ...
	]
}
```

### Adding the content

:::caution
Please read our [General editing rules and tips](../writing-guide/general-rules)

#### Templates

Right now we don't have doc templates. We will create them in the future, once we establish
some kind of a standard.

We have examples of good docs that you should visit and possibly use them as a temporary template:

Documentation:

- [std::array reference](/docs/std/containers/arrays/array/) - a good template for class summary page
- [std::basic_string constructors](/docs/std/containers/strings/string/constructor/) - a good template for constructors or other methods
- [std::basic_string::at](/docs/std/containers/strings/string/at/) - a good (?) template for class methods

Learning:
- [First program (Basics)](/learn/course/basics/first-program/)
- [Functions (Basics)](/learn/course/basics/functions/)
- [Structures (Basics)](/learn/course/basics/structures/)
