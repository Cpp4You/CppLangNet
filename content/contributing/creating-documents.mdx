# Creating documents

import ImproveSection from "@site/i18n/en/presets/ImproveSection.mdx";

:::tip

Its highly recommended for you to first view many of already existing docs, to
learn by example.

:::

If you want to do so, please visit first our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/3MeXQ8TvBw),
then ask if there's a need for such an article, or if the course edit would be reasonable.
You can do that or create an issue directly on GitHub, however the communication is
easier and faster on the Discord server.

## Templates

Right now we don't got doc templates, we will create them in the future, once we establish
some kind of a standard.

We have examples of good docs that you should visit and possibly use them as a temporary template:

Documentation:

- [std::array reference](/docs/std/containers/arrays/array/) - a good template for class summary page
- [std::basic_string constructors](/docs/std/containers/strings/string/constructor/) - a good template for constructors or other methods
- [std::basic_string::at](/docs/std/containers/strings/string/at/) - a good (?) template for class methods

Learning:
- [First program (Basics)](/learn/course/basics/first-program/)
- [Structures (Basics)](/learn/course/basics/structures/)


## Overview

:::note
Visit [this link](https://docusaurus.io/docs/create-doc) to learn how to create docs in Docusaurus.
:::

Let's say that you want to write a lesson about class constructors.

First, make sure that you've created a English version of the document, even if you leave
it empty. **Pick a lowercase name without spaces, separated by hyphens**, for example:

```
class-constructors.mdx
```

Start by filling a [metadata of the document](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-content-docs#markdown-frontmatter).
Open it, and at the very top create a **document metadata** section.

```md
---
sidebar_position:	1
sidebar_label:		"1. Class constructors"
title:				"Class constructors"
description:		"Lesson: basics of class constructors in C++ language"
tags:				[class, constructor, method, object, object-oriented-programming, object-oriented, oop]
hide_title:			true
---
```

The `sidebar_position` field is **mandatory**, but you should fill other fields too.

:::danger
`hide_title: true` should be only used when there is something between metadata and the Markdown H1 heading,
for example:

```md
---
...
hide_title:			true
---

<!-- Components -->
import Columns			from "@site-comps/Columns";

<!-- Presets -->
import NotFinished		from "@site/i18n/en/presetsNotFinished";

# The title of the document
```

Do not use it if metadata is directly above `# The title of the document`, because
Docusaurus will generate an additional H1 heading.
