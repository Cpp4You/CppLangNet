Please keep in mind that this project is still in its early stages and we are
looking for contributors to help us with the development of the website.
We're open to changes of any kind.

Also note that the goal of the "Learn" category is to teach people from the very beginning,
people that could've never learned programming before. Therefore we allow for 
simple explanations that may skip more advanced things that we will teach
in later lessons.

The main difference between "Docs" and "Learn" section is:
- [**docs**](/docs/) should not skip topics, but should be ordered from the most important and common knowledge
to the most specialized things
- [**learn**](/learn/) can skip details (and come back to them in later lessons) in order to provide easy and smooth learning
experience
