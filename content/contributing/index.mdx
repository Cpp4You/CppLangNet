## On docs and the course

It's important to note that the goal of the "Learn" category is to teach people from the very beginning,
such as those who have never learned programming before. As such, we allow for simple explanations that may omit
more advanced topics that will be covered in later lessons.

The main difference between the [**docs**](/docs/) and [**learn**](/learn/) sections is that the "Docs" section should not skip any topics,
but should be organized starting with the most important and commonly used knowledge and progressing to the most specialized topics.
Whereas in the "Learn" section, it's acceptable to skip some details in order to provide an easy and smooth learning experience,
and these topics can be covered in later lessons.
