# Introduction to programming

import CustomCodeBlock from '@site-comps/CustomCodeBlock';

You are in the C++ learning sub-site. Here you will find a C++ language course
and other materials that revolve around programming in it.

Before you move on to the C++ course, you'll have to learn what programming is about.

## What is programming

Programming is used to automate tasks that will be later executed on a machine.
In the C++ course, you will learn how to create programs that can run on a computer.
Thanks to this, you will be able to develop applications that, for example:

- can do calculations for you âž• âž– âœ– âž—
- are video games ðŸŽ® ðŸ˜„
- will do your routine, monotonous computer chores ðŸ–¨ â˜•

:::tip Video games ðŸŽ®
A few words from the author of this website: I love creating computer games.
I really enjoy teaching programming using examples from games and you will definitely
find those in this course. I consider it a great form of learning, that combines
knowledge with pleasure!

### What programmers do

Programmers write code. We will show you how to do it in a way that complies
with the rules of the C++ language and we will teach you good programming practices.

Here's a simple C++ code that computes the area of a trapezoid for you:

<CustomCodeBlock maxLines={15} resizable>

```cpp title="main.cpp" showLineNumbers
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	float a = 15;
	float b = 10;
	float h = 5;

	std::cout << "TRAPEZOID AREA CALCULATOR\n";

	std::cout << "Provide length of base a: ";
	std::cin >> a;

	std::cout << "Provide length of base b: ";
	std::cin >> b;

	std::cout << "Provide height h: ";
	std::cin >> h;

	if (a > 0 && b > 0 && h > 0)
	{
		std::cout << "Area of the trapezoid with:\n";
		std::cout << "a = " << a << "\n";
		std::cout << "b = " << b << "\n";
		std::cout << "h = " << h << "\n";
		std::cout << "equals: ";
		std::cout << (a + b) * h / 2;
	}
	else
	{
		std::cout << "Each length has to be greater than 0!\n";
	}
}
```

If you want to know how it works, **the answer is in the course**!

The C++ code is not directly understood by the computer. Before we can run it,
we need to pass the code through the **compiler** (more on that later),
which will first check that the code is valid in the C++ language,
and if so, then translate it into one that is understood by computers.

### What is C++ for

C++ is a **general purpose** programming language. You can use it to create
anything you can really think of. However, it's worth knowing where C++
works best:

- in the computer games industry (e.g. using Unreal Engine 5)
- in creating desktop applications (those where performance is important)
- in creating servers
- in programming microcontrollers

Currently C++ is not the best solution if you want to:

- create web pages (use Javascript instead)
- develop mobile and office applications that do not require very high performance

### Things worth remembering

Learning a programming language is a long process, and C++ is **very** extensive.
This does not mean that learning it has to be difficult - quite the contrary!
This site is mainly designed to break down thinking of C++ as a language that is a fear for students.

Extensive doesn't have to mean difficult!

## It's time to start learning

I wish you patience and perseverance in learning, you will see that
it can be very interesting and rewarding.
