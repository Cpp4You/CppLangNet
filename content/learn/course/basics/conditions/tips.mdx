# Conditions ¬ª Tips and style

This article is simply an unordered collection of tips and tricks to help you improve
how you write your conditional code. If you have been following this course in order,
many of the concepts used here have not been covered yet. Do not worry if you don't
understand some of the stuff in this article, they will come in later lessons.

## Always include the curly brackets

Most C++ constructs you may come across actually have **optional curly brackets**.
If you omit the curly brackets, then it is assumed the next line of code is in the 
body of the if statement, and anything else after that is outside of the if statement.

This can sometimes make for shorter, slightly easier to read code. For example:

```cpp title="üîπ Omitting the curly brackets"
if (A and B)
    std::cout << "They're both true!\n";

std::cout << "Goodbye!";
```

However, this is a very common beginner trap as this can quickly lead to the wrong behavior.
Especially upon editing the code, it is common to accidentally forget to add the braces 
when expanding the if statement body. 
Remember, C++ does not care about whitespace or indentation,
so if you try to do:

```cpp title="‚ö†Ô∏è Misleading indentation"
if (A and B)
    std::cout << "They're both true!\n";
    // warning-next-line
    std::cout << "That's cool that they are both true.\n";

std::cout << "Goodbye!";
```

The highlighted line will **always be run**, as it is not a part of the if statement.
It is equivalent to putting the curly braces only after the line that immediately follows
the if statement. Due to the frequency that beginners get bitten by this mistake,
it is recommended to always put braces on your if statements.
Mistakes like this have even caused caused [major security vulnerabilities in 
real-world codebases](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2014/02/24/anatomy-of-a-goto-fail-apples-ssl-bug-explained-plus-an-unofficial-patch/).

## Keep indentation consistent

One of the most common gripes with advanced programmers helping beginners is that
their code is super messy! This makes it difficult to read and even harder if you're
trying to help them figure out errors. One of the best ways to make your code cleaner
and easier to understand is by keeping your indentation consistent. Thankfully, this is very easy.

Every time you enter a *scope*, you should indent your code one more level with the tab key.
Every time you exit a scope, you should unindent one level. A scope is basically one "block"
of C++. Inside a function is a single scope, inside an if statement is a single scope, inside
a for loop is a single scope, etc. Below are examples of what good and bad indentation looks like.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="good" label="‚úîÔ∏è Good Indentation" default>

```cpp
// The parts of the functions are always unindented
// While immediately inside the function, it is indented at one level
bool checkValue(int x) {
    // The parts of the if statement are indented one level 
    // because it is immediately inside the function
    if (x < 50) {
        // Inside the if statement, we indent another level
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    } // The braces line up with what started the scope
}

int main() {
    // Everything in the root scope of the function is indented one level
    int value;
    std::cin >> value;

    // The outer parts of this while loop are indented one level
    while (true) {
        // Inside the while loop, we indent another level
        if (checkValue(value)) {
            // Inside another scope, so we indent a third level
            std::cout << "You have entered a good value.\n";
            break;
        }

        // We drop one indent level after exiting the if statement scope
        std::cout << "You have entered a bad value.\n";
        std::cout << "Try again.\n";
    } // This brace lines up with the while loop that started this scope

    // We return to a single level of indentation after exiting the while loop scope
    std::cout << "Goodbye!";
} // This brace lines up with the beginning of the function
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="bad" label="‚ùå Bad Indentation" default>

```cpp


bool checkValue(int x) {

// This if statement should be indentented one
if (x < 50) {
return true; // This line is missing two indentations
        } else { 
                return false; // The indentation here is obviously not consistent
}} // These braces should be on their own lines and properly indented


    // The function is indented too far over
    int main() {

    int value; 
        std::cin >> value; // The indentation here is not consistent for the same scope


    while (true) {
    // This if statement is missing an indentation level
    if (checkValue(value)) {
        std::cout << "You have entered a good value.\n"; break; // Don't put two things on one line
        } // This brace does not line up with what created it



// These lines are not indented
std::cout << "You have entered a bad value.\n";
std::cout << "Try again.\n";
} // This brace does not line up with the while loop that created it

            // This line is not consistent with the rest of the indentation in this scope
            std::cout << "Goodbye!";
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can see how all of the code in the first example is neatly aligned. We follow consistent rules of 
when to indent based off how deep of a scope we are in. Each level of nesting
a scope warrants an extra level of indentation. Additionally, all of our braces
are lined up with the parent that "started" the scope, which makes it easy to find
what construct a brace belongs to.

On the other hand, the code in the second example is significantly more confusing and frustrating to read.
It's very difficult to find what code belongs to what scope, where scopes end, and what should be executed when.
Additionally, it's just generally very messy to read and is a pain to try to look through.

It may seem like extra work to keep indentation clean and consistent,
especially if you are making changes to existing code.
But, follow these guidelines and I promise that you will thank yourself later.
It is far too common for beginners to be misled by poor indentation,
and fixing it at the source is the best way to prevent this.

If you find dealing with indentation to be difficult, consider using hotkeys to your advantage.
In most code editors, you can indent multiple lines at once by selecting what you want to indent and pressing the `Tab` key.
Conversely, you can unindent multiple lines at once with `Shift+Tab`.

## Avoid complicated boolean expressions

If you're trying to build a condition that requires the validation of multiple boolean expressions,
it can be very easy to make confusing code by using too many `and`'s, `or`'s, and `not`'s.
The best way to prevent this is to make a `bool` returning function that computes this
complicated expression for you. That way, the code becomes more readable and more maintainable.
You may also find the methods from the next section to be helpful.

## Avoid deep nesting of conditions

It is very easy to make complicated logic with if statements, especially if you 
excessively nest them inside of each other. For example, try to figure out 
what the following snippet actually does:

```cpp title="‚ö†Ô∏è Confusing if statements"
if (A or B) {
    if (not B and C) {
        if (A or D) {
            if (A and not B) {
                std::cout << "Hello!";
            } else {
                std::cout << "Will this line ever be run?";
            }
        } else if (not D) {
            std::cout << "What about this one?";
        }
    } else {
        std::cout << "It's starting to get pretty weird now...";
    }
} else if (B) {
    std::cout << "I don't think this one will ever run.";
} else if (not A and not b) {
    std::cout << "Surely, this one will be called eventually.";
} else {
    std::cout << "Goodbye!";
}
```

It may take you several minutes to figure out under what cases each of
these print statements activates, especially if you're working in
large and potentially very complicated code bases.

There are two good ways to improve this. First, you can break out
the inner nested conditions into their own [functions](/learn/course/basics/functions/).
That way, the complexity gets hidden away behind a layer of *abstraction*, and you are
forced to create a descriptive name for each function you create.

The second method applies if you have a clear "happy path" and "sad path".
You can reorganize the if statements such that the happy path is the least indented, and
the sad path escapes early. Study this example to see what this may look like:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="good" label="‚úîÔ∏è Good if statements" default>

```cpp
using std::string;

string loginAsAdmin(string user, string pass) {
    if (not doesUserExist(user)) {
        return "User does not exist";
    }

    if (not isPasswordCorrect(user, pass)) {
        return "Password is incorrect";
    }
    
    if (not tryLogin(user, pass)) {
        return "Failed to login";
    }

    if (not isAdmin(user)) {
        return "User is not admin";
    }

    return "Success";
}
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="bad" label="‚ö†Ô∏è Confusing if statements" default>

```cpp
using std::string;

string loginAsAdmin(string user, string pass) {
    if (doesUserExist(user)) {
        if (isPasswordCorrect(user, pass)) {
            if (tryLogin(user, pass)) {
                if (isAdmin(user)) {
                    return "Success";
                } else {
                    return "User is not admin";
                }
            } else {
                return "Failed to login";
            }
        } else {
            return "Password is incorrect";
        }
    } else {
        return "User does not exist";
    }
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can see how the confusing example has a tell-tale triangular shape.
This is a very common indicator that you are nesting your logic too deep,
and you should apply one of the two clean-up methods to fix it. Here,
we inverted the conditions to check the sad path first. The happy path
continues at the bottom once we have passed all of the checks.
