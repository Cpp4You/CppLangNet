# Introduction to Conditions

So far, we've been creating programs that worked the same way every time.
Our creations could not make decisions. Now is the time to change that.
In this lesson we will provide branching paths for our programs to execute
based on what the user types in. This will be a guided lesson in which we
will make an application that checks if the user can legally get a Driver's License. 😎

## Code preparation

Let's first ask the user for their year of birth.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Welcome to the Driver's License Oracle 2000\n";
	std::cout << "Please enter your year of birth: ";

	int yearOfBirth;
	std::cin >> yearOfBirth;

	// Year 2022 at the moment of writing this lesson
	int age = 2022 - yearOfBirth;

	// highlight-start
	// Case A:
	std::cout << "You can legally get a driver's license\n";
	// highlight-end

	// highlight-start
	// Case B:
	std::cout << "You cannot legally get a driver's license\n";
	// highlight-end
}
```

Here, I've highlighted two pieces of code — one where the user can legally get a driver's license,
and another where they cannot. We only want one of these segments to execute, not both. How can we do that?
First, we should specify what the "cases" are, and under what conditions they should execute.

- Case A — Legal — This should be executed only when `age` is greater than or equal to `18`
- Case B — Illegal — This should be executed only when `age` is less than `18`

Continue on and you'll see how we can translate these cases into code.

## Conditional statements

The simplest form of a condition in C++ is the `if` statement, the basic form of which is as follows:

```cpp title="🔹 Anatomy of an if statement"
if (/* boolean condition */) 
{
	// The code in here executes only if the condition evaluates to true
}

// The code out here executes regardless of whether the condition is true or false
```

To use an `if` statement, we need two things:
1. A condition that results in a boolean `true`/`false` value when evaluated
2. Code to execute when the condition evaluates to `true`

After an `if` keyword, we put a boolean condition inside of parentheses.
Then, the braces that surround #2 create what's known as a **block of code**. <u>Everything inside this code block will be
executed if and only if the condition is true</u>. Variables that are created in a code block live and die with that 
code block — they are destroyed when the block ends (with the closing brace `}` ) and are completely inaccessible
from outside it.

Let's apply this to our Driver's License example by combining the if statement with the cases we previously determined:

```cpp title="🔹 First attempt at using if statements"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Welcome to the Driver's License Oracle 2000\n";
	std::cout << "Please enter your year of birth: ";

	int yearOfBirth;
	std::cin >> yearOfBirth;

	// Year 2022 at the moment of writing this lesson
	int age = 2022 - yearOfBirth;

	// highlight-start
	// Case A:
	if (/* age is greater than or equal to 18*/)
	{
		std::cout << "You can legally get a driver's license\n";
	}
	// highlight-end

	// highlight-start
	// Case B:
	if (/* age is less than 18 */)
	{
		std::cout << "You cannot legally get a driver's license\n";
	}
	// highlight-end
}
```

Notice here how we have two `if` statements, one for each case.
The first one handles our Case A, where they can legally obtain a driver's license.
The second one handles our Case B, where they cannot legally obtain a driver's license.

Upon closer inspection, one fact should quickly become obvious — these cases are **mutually exclusive**.
This means that it is not possible for both cases to be true; only one or the other can execute.
C++ provides the `else` keyword to delineate mutually exclusive conditions. While the above code
will work as expected, we can improve it like so:

```cpp title="🔹 Anatomy of an if-else statement"
if (/* boolean condition */)
{
	// The code in here executes only if the condition evalutes to true
}
else
{
	// The code in here executes only if the condition evalutes to false
}

// The code out here executes regardless of whether the condition is true or false
```
This `else` block is optional, and you should only use it if you want mutual exclusion.

Now we can turn back to our example and see only one condition is necessary,
as if one is true then the other must be false.


```cpp title="🔹 First attempt at using an if-else statement"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Welcome to the Driver's License Oracle 2000\n";
	std::cout << "Please enter your year of birth: ";

	int yearOfBirth;
	std::cin >> yearOfBirth;

	// Year 2022 at the moment of writing this lesson
	int age = 2022 - yearOfBirth;

	// highlight-start
	if (/* age is greater than or equal to 18*/)
	{
		std::cout << "You can legally get a driver's license\n";
	}
	else
	{
		std::cout << "You cannot legally get a driver's license\n";
	}
	// highlight-end
}
```

:::danger No semicolon `;`

Don't put semicolon (`;`) after the parentheses of the `if` statement.
This won't cause a compiler error but it **will** cause your code to
not behave correctly. The conditional code block will always be executed.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="right" label="✔ Right" default>

```cpp
if (age >= 18) 
// ...
else
// ...
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="wrong" label="❌ Wrong">

```cpp
if (age >= 18);
// ...
else;
// ...
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::

To recap, we have learned how to separate conditionally executed cases in our code into
dedicated if statements. This allows us to choose what code gets run depending on various
values in our program. Now that we have the basic structure of our if-else statement,
we can see how to finish our program by creating the boolean condition.

## Boolean expressions

Inside the parenthesis of an `if` statement is the **boolean expression**, i.e. an expression
that evaluates to either `true` or `false`. C++ provides several new operators that allow
us to form such an expression.

### Boolean operators

Below is a table that shows some of the **boolean operators** available in C++. A boolean operator
is one that returns a boolean `true`/`false` based on its input(s). 
They are like the other mathematical operators you've seen in previous lessons, but instead
of evaluating to a number like `int`, they evaluate to a `bool` (`true`/`false`).

| C++ operator | Math equivalent | Description |
| -------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| `a == b` | a **=** b |Is `a` equal to `b`? |
| `a != b` | a ≠ b | Is `a` not equal to `b`? |
| `a > b` | a **&gt;** b | Is `a` strictly greater than `b`? |
| `a >= b` | a ≥ b | Is `a` greater than or equal to `b`? |
| `a < b` | a **&lt;** b | Is `a` strictly less than `b`? |
| `a <= b` | a ≤ b | Is `a` less than or equal to `b`? |

#### Equality operators
The first two rows of our table `==` and `!=` make up the **equality operators**.
These two operators allow us to check if two values are the same. 
The equality operators work on most C++ types, including numbers, strings, bools, and more.

:::danger
A single `=` is different from a double `==`. The single `=` is the **assignment operator**, such as when you create or change a variable.
The double `==` is the **equality operator**, used when you want to check if two variables have the same value.

So inside an `if` statement's condition, when you want to check for equality:
- ✔ `if (a == b)`
- ❌ `if (a = b)`
:::

#### Relational operators
The next four rows of our table make up the **relational operators**.
These two operators allow us to compare two values positionally (such as on a number line
or alphabetically).
The relational operators work on some C++ types, like numbers and strings; however,
many other types that we have not covered yet cannot be compared like this.

We now know enough to get the first version of our program functioning. As a reminder,
we need to make a condition that checks whether the user's age is greater than 
or equal to 18. Using the table above, the closest match is `age >= 18`.
Now we can fill in our `if` statement:

```cpp title="🔹 Driver's License Oracle 2000"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Welcome to the Driver's License Oracle 2000\n";
	std::cout << "Please enter your year of birth: ";

	int yearOfBirth;
	std::cin >> yearOfBirth;

	// Year 2022 at the moment of writing this lesson
	int age = 2022 - yearOfBirth;

	// highlight-next-line
	if (age >= 18)
	{
		std::cout << "You can legally get a driver's license\n";
	}
	else
	{
		std::cout << "You cannot legally get a driver's license\n";
	}
}
```

As a bonus challenge, try to form three other equivalent formulations of `age >= 18`, using the other remaining relational operators for each one.

### Compound boolean expressions

You can transform and combine boolean expressions by what are called the **logical operators**.
These are a subset of the boolean operators initially introduced above, but they are intended to take 
boolean value(s) as input. 

C++ supports two equivalent forms of these operators, a textual version
and a symbolic version. While the symbolic representation is more common in the wild, you may find
the textual representation to be easier to understand and remember. You can use whichever you like
best, but try to be consistent!

| C++ operator | Alternative representation | Description |
| -------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| `a and b` | `a && b` | Are **both** `a` AND `b` true? |
| `a or b` | <code>a &#x7C;&#x7C;  b</code>  | Is **either** `a` OR `b` true? |
| `not c` | `!c` | Is `c` false? |

#### Logical AND operator

The logical AND operator `and`/`&&` takes two boolean inputs and returns `true` if and only if 
both of its inputs are `true`. It's best to use this when you want to check if multiple conditions are
all true, or whether multiple conditions are `false` (by also using the negation operator).

For example, `false && true` is `false`, while `true and true` is `true`.

#### Logical OR operator

Similar to AND, the logical OR operator `or`/`||` takes two boolean inputs and returns `true` if 
one or both of its inputs are `true`. It's best to use this when you want to check if any of multiple 
conditions are true, or if one variable is one of many possibilites. 

For example, `false or false` is `false`, while `false || true` is `true`

#### Logical NOT operator
Pay close attention to the last row in the above table; `not`/`!` is also known as the **logical negation operator**.
This operator will flip the truth value of a *single* boolean input. So in the expression `!c`, `c` is 
a boolean ( `true`/`false` ), and the `!` negation operator will turn `true→false` and `false→true`.
This is equivalent to asking whether `c` is `false`. This operator is useful when you want
to check whether some condition does not hold.

For example, `!(a == b)` is equivalent to `a != b`.
Likewise, `not (a <= b)` is equivalent to `a > b`.
Take note of how parentheses are used here to evaluate the inner expression first before logically
negating it.

#### Upgrading the Oracle

The state has passed new regulations and now we must upgrade our Oracle program to comply.
The new law stipulates a maximum age for driver's licenses — <u>those 65 years and older are
no longer allowed to operate a motor vehicle</u>.

We need to expand on our boolean condition to abide by this new requirement. Currently,
`age >= 18` sets the *lower bound* for the range of acceptable values.
We are missing something that sets the *upper bound*, which should be 65. 
A boolean expression that checks if the age is less than 65 could look like `age < 65`.
Note that we use `<` instead of `<=` because 65 year olds are banned from driving.

Now we have `age >= 18` and `age < 65`, which must be combined in some way.
We need to somehow specify that BOTH must be true — the person must be 
18 or older AND younger than 65 to get a driver's license. 

Looking back at the table in [Compound boolean expressions](#compound-boolean-expressions), 
we can see that the `and`/`&&` operator fits this situation best.
We can write this compound condition like `age >= 18 and age < 65`. Note
that the left/right order here does not matter, meaning that
`age < 65 and age >= 18` is an equivalent condition.


```cpp title="🔹 Driver's License Oracle 3000"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Welcome to the Driver's License Oracle 3000\n";
	std::cout << "Please enter your year of birth: ";

	int yearOfBirth;
	std::cin >> yearOfBirth;

	// Year 2022 at the moment of writing this lesson
	int age = 2022 - yearOfBirth;

	// highlight-next-line
	if (age >= 18 and age < 65)
	{
		std::cout << "You can legally get a driver's license\n";
	}
	else
	{
		std::cout << "You cannot legally get a driver's license\n";
	}
}
```

:::danger Chaining equality or relational operators
You may be tempted to rewrite the above compound condition like `18 <= age < 65`.
However, this **will not work**. While it will compile, it will result in incorrect
behavior as it will always evaluate to `true`. 

The same incorrect behavior also occurs with the equality operators. 
For example, `age1 == age2 == 18` or `age1 != age2 != 35` will both behave similarly
to the above example, either always returning false or always returning true.

Never attempt to chain equality or relational operators.
Always use the logical operators `and`/`&&` or `or`/`||` to combine boolean expressions.

### Order of Operations
Like the mathematical operators, the boolean operators also have their own priority schedule
they strictly adhere to. Similar to "PEMDAS", those inside parentheses always gets evaluated
first, and the other operators are computed according to their priorities listed below. 
Highest priority is on top.

| Operator | Name | Associativity |
| -------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| `!` `not` | Logical NOT | Right-to-left 🡠 |
| `*` `/` `%` | Multiplication/Division  | Left-to-right 🡢 |
| `+` `-` | Addition/Substraction  | Left-to-right 🡢 |
| `<` `<=` `>` `>=` | Relational operators  | Left-to-right 🡢 |
| `==` `!=` | Equality operators | Left-to-right 🡢 |
| `&&` `and` | Logical AND | Left-to-right 🡢 |
| <code>&#x7C;&#x7C;</code> `or` | Logical OR | Left-to-right 🡢 |

Let's use this to analyze some examples.

```cpp title="🔹 Order of Operations showcase"
a > 10 and a < 100 or a == 150
// equivalent to
(a > 10 and a < 100) or a == 150

a * 4 == b + 5
// equivalent to
(a * 4) == (b + 5)

not a or b < 3701
// equivalent to
(not a) or (b < 3701)

not a != false
// equivalent to
(not a) != false
```
:::tip Use parentheses for disambiguation
It's best practice to not rely on the implicit rules of operator precedence too much.
It can be hard for programmers to remember all of the rules about which operator gets
evaluated first, so writing too much code that depends on these rules can make it 
harder to read and understand. If you intend for a subexpression to be evaluated first,
it's a good idea to put it in parentheses.

So, instead of writing `a and b and c or a and not b`, consider doing `(a and b and c) or (a and not b)` instead.
