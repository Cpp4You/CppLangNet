# Conditions » Additional information

## The `bool` type

The data type `bool` is used to store Boolean values - `true` and `false`.

Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Please enter your year of birth: ";
	std::cin >> yearOfBirth;

	int age = 2021 - yearOfBirth;

	// highlight-next-line
	bool isAdult = age >= 18;

	// highlight-next-line
	if (isAdult)
		std::cout << "You can get a driver's license.";
	else
		std::cout << "You're not allowed to get a driver's license yet.";
}
```

The result of the expression `age >= 18` (either `true` or `false`) is assigned
to a variable `isAdult`. Then, if `isAdult` is true, we'll see the following text
in the console:

```
You can get a driver's license.
```

otherwise:

```
You're not allowed to get a driver's license yet.
```

By using the negation operator on a variable of type `bool`, we can easily toggle its state:

```cpp
bool isButtonPressed = true; // 👍

isButtonPressed = !isButtonPressed; // changes from true 👍 to false 👎
isButtonPressed = !isButtonPressed; // now it changes from false 👎 to true 👍

isButtonPressed = !!isButtonPressed; // double negation -> no effect
```
