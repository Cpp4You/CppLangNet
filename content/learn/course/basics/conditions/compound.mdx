# Compound Conditions

So far, we know how to represent a series of potential cases in our C++ code using the `if` block.
We also learned how we can write two mutually exclusive cases by utilizing the `if/else` construct.
Then, we saw how to combine boolean expressions together via the logical operators.

Further on, it is very common for programmers to be faced with three or more mutually exclusive cases.
We can effectively deal with this situation by a new concept: the `if/else if/else` statement.

## Compound Conditional Statements

```cpp title="🔹 Anatomy of an if/else if/else statement"
if (/* boolean condition */) 
{
	// The code in here executes only if the condition evaluates to true
} 
else if (/* boolean condition */)
{
	// The code in here executes only if the previous condition evaluates to false
	// and the this condition evaluates to true
}
else
{
	// This code in here executes if and only if all of the previous conditions
	// evaluated to false
}
```

The `if/else if/else` statement can represent multiple mutually exclusive cases.
The cases' conditions are evaluated from top to bottom, and if any of them
are true then it will execute that case's code then jump out of the entire structure.
If none of the boolean conditions evaluate to true, then the `else` block will
finally be executed. Thus, all of these cases in entire chain are *mutually exclusive*.

The `else` is totally optional, and there can be any number of `else if` blocks. 
In fact, you may realize that the `if/else` discussed earlier is the case where
there are zero `else if`'s.

Thus, we can now see how all of `if`, `if/else`, and `if/else if/else` are really
just one greater system that we call the **if statement.** An if statement 
always starts with an `if` block, optionally followed by any number of `else if`
blocks, and optionally followed by an `else` block.

You should only combine cases into additional `else if/else` clauses when they
are mutually exclusive. If you have multiple sets of independent cases where
you want multiple to potentially execute, you should keep them as separate if statements.

Let's use this new tool to upgrade our program even further.

### Reinventing the Oracle

More regulations have been passed down from above. Now, there is a new license system
being put in place. Drivers shall be segmented into different classes of 
license by their age. The rules are as follows:

- Drivers between the ages of `18` and `21` inclusive are given a Class C license
- Drivers between the ages of `22` and `30` inclusive are given a Class B license
- Drivers between the ages of `31` and `50` inclusive are given a Class A license
- Drivers between the ages of `51` and `64` inclusive are given a Class C license
- Drivers outside of these age ranges cannot receive a driver's license.

```cpp title="🔹 Driver's License Oracle 4000"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
	std::cout << "Welcome to the Driver's License Oracle 4000\n";

	int yearOfBirth;
	std::cout << "Please enter your year of birth: ";
	std::cin >> yearOfBirth;

	// Year 2022 at the moment of writing this lesson
	int age = 2022 - yearOfBirth;

	// highlight-start
	if ((age >= 18 and age <= 21) or (age >= 51 and age <= 64)) {
		std::cout << "You can legally get a Class C driver's license\n";
	} else if (age >= 22 and age <= 30) {
		std::cout << "You can legally get a Class B driver's license\n";
	} else if (age >= 31 and age <= 50) {
		std::cout << "You can legally get a Class A driver's license\n";
	} else {
		std::cout << "You cannot legally get a driver's license because you are not between 18 and 64 years old\n";
	}
	// highlight-end
}
```

Analyzing this new if statement should hopefully be straightforward. Our first case, for Class C drivers,
has two conditions under which it it will be issued: the person is between 18 and 21 years old,
or they are between 51 and 64 years old. So, we use a [compound condition](#compound-conditions) to build this logic by combining
two `and` expressions with a single `or` operator. Thus, we are separetly checking the two ranges 
simultaneously.

Now, you could certainly do the Class C case without the `or` operator by putting the second `and` expression
into a dedicated `else if` clause. However, because they both end up executing the same code (giving the user
a Class C license), it's best to combine them into a single condition to avoid repeating the code.
The general practice of avoiding repetition is called **Don't Repeat Yourself** aka DRY, and it's a very good 
philosophy to keep in mind. 
Following the DRY principle will lead to more maintainable, more readable code with fewer chances for bugs.

Back to the main topic at hand, the other cases are clearly laid out with `else if` clauses. 
We build each of these using an `and` operator to build a *lower bound* and *upper bound* for each of the cases.
Finally, we use the `else` clause as the "catch-all" to reject anyone whose ages didn't fall into the predefined boundaries.

### Using variables to reduce repetition

It may seem odd that after all that talk of not repeating yourself, that we have nearly the same line of code repeated three times.
Notice how the `std::cout << "..."` is almost identical for all of Class A, B, and C licenses — only a single letter is different
in each of the cases. We can use this to our advantage by creating a *variable* that stores a single character.
Then, we change our if statements to assign this variable the respective license class. Finally, we output 
the final message combined with the license variable we created.


```cpp title="⚠️ Driver's License Oracle 4500"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
	std::cout << "Welcome to the Driver's License Oracle 4500\n";

	int yearOfBirth;
	std::cout << "Please enter your year of birth: ";
	std::cin >> yearOfBirth;

	// Year 2022 at the moment of writing this lesson
	int age = 2022 - yearOfBirth;

	// highlight-next-line
	char licenseClass = 'X'; // X is chosen as a default value to signal if we miss one of our cases

	if ((age >= 18 and age <= 21) or (age >= 51 and age <= 64)) {
		licenseClass = 'C';
	} else if (age >= 22 and age <= 30) {
		licenseClass = 'B';
	} else if (age >= 31 and age <= 50) {
		licenseClass = 'A';
	} else {
		std::cout << "You cannot legally get a driver's license because you are not between 18 and 64 years old\n";
	}

	// warning-next-line
	std::cout << "You can legally get a Class " << licenseClass << " driver's license\n";
}
```

The code above does exactly what we described. We created a `char` variable to hold our license class,
then we used the if statements to assign the respective class to that variable. However, this code
will not work as intended!
Look back to the [Anatomy of an if statement](/learn/course/basics/conditions/intro/#conditional-statements),
and notice the comment underneath the entire if statement — it says
"The code out here executes regardless of whether the condition is true or false."

So, the code will work correctly if we can legally get a driver's license. If we input `2000` as our
birth year, then it will print out `You can legally get a Class C driver's license` as expected.
But, if we say we were born in `2015`, it will print out:

```
You cannot legally get a driver's license because you are not between 18 and 64 years old
You can legally get a Class X driver's license
```

... which is incorrect! It's printing out both of the cases *because* we moved the legal output to outside of the if statement. 
What we need to do is create then another if statement that checks to see if we gave the user a valid license or not.
We can easily do this because of how we set `'X'` to be the default license value. This means that anyone that 
did not receive a license will still have an `'X'` as the value of `licenseClass`, and we can check this with a condition.


```cpp title="🔹 Driver's License Oracle 4500"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
	std::cout << "Welcome to the Driver's License Oracle 4500\n";

	int yearOfBirth;
	std::cout << "Please enter your year of birth: ";
	std::cin >> yearOfBirth;

	// Year 2022 at the moment of writing this lesson
	int age = 2022 - yearOfBirth;

	char licenseClass = 'X'; // X is chosen as a default value to signal if we miss one of our cases

	if ((age >= 18 and age <= 21) or (age >= 51 and age <= 64)) {
		licenseClass = 'C';
	} else if (age >= 22 and age <= 30) {
		licenseClass = 'B';
	} else if (age >= 31 and age <= 50) {
		licenseClass = 'A';
	// highlight-next-line
	} // This else statement was removed to make the print a part of the following if instead

	// highlight-start
	if (licenseClass != 'X') {
		std::cout << "You can legally get a Class " << licenseClass << " driver's license\n";
	} else {
		std::cout << "You cannot legally get a driver's license because you are not between 18 and 64 years old\n";
	}
	// highlight-end
}
```

You can see here how we've made a new if statement that checks `licenseClass != 'X'`. This serves as the conditional
statement for choosing whether we gave a license to the user or not; then, we dispatch the *control flow* to
the proper print statement depending on the answer to that condition. 
We have now reenabled the mutual exclusion of these two outputs.

By using variables and applying the DRY principle,
you can see that we reduced the repetition of our code.
This has made it more readable, more maintainable, and easier to debug.

### Nesting conditional statements

The inside of an if statement is nothing special. You can put any valid executable code inside of an if statement's body,
just like how all the code inside the body of `main` is valid executable code. Thus, it should be easy to "nest"
if statements by putting one inside of the body of another.

```cpp title="🔹 Example of a nested if statement"
if (/* Condition 1 */) {
	// Code here gets run if Condition 1 is true

	// Since this if statement is inside another if statement,
	// it only gets evaluated if the outer if statement's body is entered;
	// ie., only if Condition 1 is true
	// highlight-start
	if (/* Condition 2 */) {
		// Code here gets run if Condition 2 is true
	} else if (/* Condition 3 */) {
		// Code here gets run if Condition 2 is false, and Condition 3 is true
	}
	// highlight-end

	// Code here gets run regardless of whether Condition 2 or 3 are true,
	// however note this is still inside the body of the outer if statement!
} else {
	// Code here gets run if Condition 1 is false
}

// Code out here gets run no matter the outcome of the above if statement
```

Here we can see a stubbed out example of what a nested if statement may look like in the wild.
Here, we have one outer if/else statement, with an if/else if statement inside of the outer one's body.

When the program runs this code, the first step it performs is checking the result of 
Condition 1. If it is true, it will step into its body and execute the code in there. Else, if
Condition 1 is false, it will jump into the else's body and execute that code. After this whole
process is done, it will then exit the entire conditional statement and continue execution
below.

Notice here that, in the case of Condition 1 being true, part of its body is *another if statement*.
So, this means that it will again make a true/false decision. So, if Condition 1 is true, it will
continue until it reaches the nested if statement. Then, it checks Condition 2. If that is true,
it executes that body. Else, if Condition 2 is false, it checks Condition 3. If Condition 3 is true,
it executes that body.

Take note of how similar these processes are overall. Nothing really changed when analyzing the behavior
of the outer if statement versus the inner if statement. If statements are extremely *modular* in this way —
their behavior is the same in any context... at the beginning of `main`, at the end of `main`, inside
another if statement, inside two if statements, inside an else body, etc.

Let's use this new tool to upgrade our Oracle even further:

The Overseer Council of Transportation Safety has issued a new requirement:
those with two or more accidents are not eligble for any class license regardless of their age.

```cpp title="🔹 Driver's License Oracle 5000"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
	std::cout << "Welcome to the Driver's License Oracle 5000\n";

	int yearOfBirth;
	std::cout << "Please enter your year of birth: ";
	std::cin >> yearOfBirth;

	int numCrashes;
	std::cout << "Please enter the number of crashes you have had: \n";
	std::cin >> numCrashes;

	// highlight-next-line
	if (numCrashes < 2) {
		// Year 2022 at the moment of writing this lesson
		int age = 2022 - yearOfBirth;

		char licenseClass = 'X'; // X is chosen as a default value to signal if we miss one of our cases

		if ((age >= 18 and age <= 21) or (age >= 51 and age <= 64)) {
			licenseClass = 'C';
		} else if (age >= 22 and age <= 30) {
			licenseClass = 'B';
		} else if (age >= 31 and age <= 50) {
			licenseClass = 'A';
		}

		if (licenseClass != 'X') {
			std::cout << "You can legally get a Class " << licenseClass << " driver's license\n";
		} else {
			std::cout << "You cannot legally get a driver's license because you are not between 18 and 64 years old\n";
		}
	// highlight-start
	} else {
		std::cout << "You cannot legally get a driver's license because you have " << numCrashes << " accidents\n";
	}
	// highlight-end
}
```

You can see here how we have moved a large chunk of the previous code into the body of the `numsCrashes` if statement.
This means that we will only perform that code if and only if the user has less than two crashes.
Otherwise, if the user has two or more crashes, the system prints out the requisite notification that they cannot
get a driver's license.

Now take notice again how we are repeating the same message twice in our code. This means there is another opportunity
to apply the DRY principles and simplify our code for future maintenance. Let's take a look:

#### Applying DRY principles once more

```cpp title="🔹 Driver's License Oracle 5500"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
	std::cout << "Welcome to the Driver's License Oracle 5500\n";

	int yearOfBirth;
	std::cout << "Please enter your year of birth: ";
	std::cin >> yearOfBirth;

	int numCrashes;
	std::cout << "Please enter the number of crashes you have had: \n";
	std::cin >> numCrashes;

	char licenseClass = 'X'; // X is chosen as a default value to signal if we miss one of our cases
	// highlight-next-line
	std::string illegalReason;

	if (numCrashes < 2) {
		// Year 2022 at the moment of writing this lesson
		int age = 2022 - yearOfBirth;

		if ((age >= 18 and age <= 21) or (age >= 51 and age <= 64)) {
			licenseClass = 'C';
		} else if (age >= 22 and age <= 30) {
			licenseClass = 'B';
		} else if (age >= 31 and age <= 50) {
			licenseClass = 'A';
		} else {
			// highlight-next-line
			illegalReason = "you are not between 18 and 64 years old";
		}
	} else {
		// highlight-next-line
		illegalReason = "you have " + std::to_string(numCrashes) + " accidents";
	}

	if (licenseClass != 'X') {
		std::cout << "You can legally get a Class " << licenseClass << " driver's license\n";
	} else {
		// highlight-next-line
		std::cout << "You cannot legally get a driver's license because " << illegalReason << "\n";
	}
}
```

We can see that this code has been improved for multiple reasons. Firstly, we are no longer repeating
ourselves, meaning that future maintenance is significantly easier in case the Overseer Council decides
to add more regulations. 

Secondly, we have now made a clean split between our "logic code" and the "display code".
If you intersperse your console i/o commands with your logical computation commands,
it can make the code become very confusing very quickly. In the Oracle 5000 program, all of our logic
for determining the `licenseClass` and `illegalReason` are in one if statement, and the
code for displaying the results ot the user are in a separate if statement.
