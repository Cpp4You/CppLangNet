# Conditions » Exercises




Suppose we want to sell pool tickets at different prices depending on age.
Here are the criteria:

- children under 6: free
- persons aged 6 to 17 inclusive: $4
- adults up to 59 years of age inclusive: $8
- people from 60 years of age: $6

We will use a `else if` construct to check the following conditions:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "SWIMMING POOL - TICKETS\n";
	std::cout << "Please enter your year of birth: ";

	int age;
	std::cin >> age;

	if (age < 6)
		std::cout << "You can enter for free";
	// highlight-next-line
	else if (age <= 17)
		std::cout << "Ticket price: $4";
	// highlight-next-line
	else if (age <= 59)
		std::cout << "Ticket price: $8";
	else
		std::cout << "Ticket price: $6";
}
```

Meeting the condition in any one of `if`s (including `else if`s) interrupts a further checking
of next `else if` statements.

:::important
Neither `else if`, nor `else` is even taken into account when one of the previous `if`s or `else if`s
condition in the chain was evaluated to `true`.
