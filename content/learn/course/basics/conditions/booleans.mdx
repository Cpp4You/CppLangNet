# Booleans

## The `bool` type

If you recall from the [Variables lesson](/learn/course/basics/variables/#variable-type),
one of basic types listed was `bool`. This type represents a **boolean**, which is a
single true/false value.

The [Boolean Expressions](/learn/course/basics/conditions/intro/#boolean-expressions)
we learned about early in this Conditions lesson create a boolean value when evaluated.
So, we can make variables that are the results of such boolean expressions, and then
further use these `bool` variables in the conditions of if statements.

C++ provides two built-in `bool` constants - `true` and `false`. You can use these wherever
a `bool` or boolean expression is expected. For example:

```cpp title="ðŸ”¹ Boolean literals"
bool var1 = true;
bool var2 = false;
```

There are more interesting things we can do with `bool` variables, too.
Any boolean expression is valid to assign here. Combining this with
if statements can make for shorter and more readable code in some cases.

```cpp title="ðŸ”¹ Using boolean variables to determine the weather"
std::string name;

std::cout << "Enter your first name: ";
std::cin >> name;

// User is lucky if their name has more than 5 characters
// highlight-next-line
bool isLucky = name.size() > 5; 

// Try changing these values yourself and see what happens!
// highlight-start
bool isTuesday = true;
bool isCloudy = false;
// highlight-end

std::string weather = "sunny";

if (not isTuesday and isCloudy) {
	weather = "raining";
} else if (isTuesday) {
	if (isCloudy) {
		weather = "overcast";
	} else if (not isLucky) {
		weather = "downpouring";
	}
}

std::cout << "It is currently " << weather << " in your location!";
```

The [logical operators](/learn/course/basics/conditions/intro/#compound-boolean-expressions) previously introduced
can also be used to create new boolean variables.

```cpp title="ðŸ”¹ Using logical operators on bools"
bool isPrecipitating = weather == "raining" or weather == "downpouring";
bool isRainbowMade   = isPrecipitating and not isCloudy;
bool isBoringDay     = not isRainbowMade;
```

## Input/Output with `bool`

If you did any self-driven exploration with this new `bool` type, you may have noticed a peculiar thing...
Printing out a `bool` does not display a `true` or `false` in the terminal. Instead, it prints out a `1` or a `0`.
This is simply a default behavior in C++ that is related to the [next section](#intbool-conversions).

You can easily change this behavior by changing one of `std::cout`'s settings.
Simply "print" out the `std::boolalhpa` built-in constant, and it will make all future boolean operations on `std::cout`
print out `true`/`false` instead of `1`/`0`.

:::tip Header include
Make sure you `#include <iomanip>` to use `std::boolalpha`.
:::

<Columns columns={['2fr', '1fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="ðŸ”¹ Printing true/false"
std::cout << true << " " << false << "\n";
// highlight-next-line
std::cout << std::boolalpha;
std::cout << true << " " << false << "\n";
```
</div>
<div>

```plaintext title="Output"
1 0
true false
```
</div>
</Columns>

Conversely, `std::cin` by default will only accept a `0` or a `1` when inputting into a `bool` variable.
This behavior can also be changed by "inputting" into the `std::boolalpha` flag.
In the example below, the user will first input `0`, which represents `false`.
Then, they will input `true` once the `std::boolalpha` setting was applied.

<Columns columns={['2fr', '1fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="ðŸ”¹ Inputting true/false"
bool var;

std::cout << "Integral form: ";
std::cin >> var;

// highlight-next-line
std::cin >> std::boolalpha;

std::cout << "Alphanumeric form: ";
std::cin >> var;
```
</div>
<div>

```plaintext title="Input/Output"
Integral form: 1
Alphanumeric form: true
```
</div>
</Columns>

As an exercise, try modifying the [weather example](#the-bool-type) from above to accept user input, using
the `std::boolalpha` modifier you just learned.

:::note Fun Fact
The name "boolalpha" comes from a portmanteau of boolean and alphanumeric.
:::

## `int`â†”`bool` conversions

C++ has another rather annoying behavior where booleans and integers can implicitly convert between each other.
A boolean value of `false` is equivalent to an integer value of `0`, and `true` is equivalent to `1`.
Conversely, an integral value of `0` is equivalent to a boolean value of `false`,
and any non-zero integer is equivalent to `true`.

```cpp title="ðŸ”¹ A sampling of intâ†”bool conversions"
int x = true; // x is 1
int y = false; // y is 0

bool a = 1; // a is true
bool b = 25; // b is true
bool c = -194; // c is true
bool d = 0; // d is false
```

While this behavior may seem neat, it can unexpectedly crop up in many places where they are not wanted.
For this reason, if you want to intentionally trigger an `int`â†”`bool` conversion, then you should *cast*
the value.

```cpp title="ðŸ”¹ Performing a cast"
int x = static_cast<int>(true); // Modern-style cast
int y = (int) false; 			// C-style cast

bool a = static_cast<bool>(1);
bool b = (bool) 0;
```

There are two primary ways to perform a cast like this in C++ - a "static cast" and a "c-style cast".
You will learn the differences between these in the Intermediate course. For now just know that,
in the case of `int`â†”`bool` conversions, both of the options are equivalent.
However, the `static_cast` method is generally preferred for Modern C++.

### Unintended Conversions

These conversions can cause issues where you least expect them to. One example is in the
[compound boolean expressions](/learn/course/basics/conditions/intro/#compound-boolean-expressions)
you learned about earlier. 
Normally, if you want to combine multiple boolean expressions together, you use the logical operators like so:

```cpp
if (x > 10 && x < 25) { ... }
```

You may be tempted to rewrite the condition as <code>10 &lt; x &lt; 25</code>. 
**This will result in incorrect behavior**, as this expression will always evaluate to `true`.
This is because there is secretly an implicit `bool`ðŸ¡¢`int` conversion occurring.
This expression gets interpreted as <code>(10 &lt; x) &lt; 25</code>.
Let's see how this causes this condition to always evaluate to `true` by using 
the [operator precedence table](/learn/course/basics/conditions/intro/#order-of-operations):

<Columns columns={['1fr', '1fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="ðŸ”¹ Incorrect operator chaining with x = 15"
10 < x < 25    // Initial expression
10 < 15 < 25   // Substitute x
(10 < 15) < 25 // Operator precedence
(true) < 25    // Evaluate subexpression
1 < 25		   // boolðŸ¡¢int conversion
true		   // Evaluate subexpression
```
</div>
<div>

```cpp title="ðŸ”¹ Incorrect operator chaining with x = 7"
10 < x < 25   // Initial expression
10 < 7 < 25   // Substitute x
(10 < 7) < 25 // Operator precedence
(false) < 25  // Evaluate subexpression
0 < 25	      // boolðŸ¡¢int conversion
true	      // Evaluate subexpression
```
</div>
</Columns>

This same issue can occur in other similar scenarios, as well.
For example, when checking if a single variable is one of many possibilities,
the correct way would be `x == 5 || x == 10 || x == 15`.
The tempting option of `x == 5 || 10 || 15` **will not work** for a similar reason to the above.
It will always be true. Let's see why:

<Columns columns={['1fr', '1fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="ðŸ”¹ Incorrect operator chaining with x = 5"
x == 5 || 10 || 15     // Initial expression
5 == 5 || 10 || 15     // Substitute x
((5 == 5) || 10) || 15 // Operator precedence
((true) || 10) || 15   // Evaluate subexpression
(true || true) || 15   // intðŸ¡¢bool conversion
true || 15             // Evaluate subexpression
true || true           // intðŸ¡¢bool conversion
true                   // Evaluate subexpression
```
</div>
<div>

```cpp title="ðŸ”¹ Incorrect operator chaining with x = 7"
x == 5 || 10 || 15     // Initial expression
7 == 5 || 10 || 15     // Substitute x
((7 == 5) || 10) || 15 // Operator precedence
((false) || 10) || 15  // Evaluate subexpression
(false || true) || 15  // intðŸ¡¢bool conversion
true || 15             // Evaluate subexpression
true || true           // intðŸ¡¢bool conversion
true                   // Evaluate subexpression
```
</div>
</Columns>
