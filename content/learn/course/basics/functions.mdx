# Functions

In this lesson you will learn how to teach a program to perform actions,
with the ability to reuse them.

## Motivation

One of the advantages of using functions is the reduction of duplicates in the code. See example
below, the version without and with functions. At this point
you do not need to understand the notation of the example with the function - we will
explain it later in this lesson.

In the example above, we create an array of numbers and modify it, displaying the contents each time.
The difference between the two versions is that the first one contains a piece of code that we have copy-pasted
several times. In the second, more correct version, we **teach our program once
how to display an array of numbers** and then use it repeatedly when we need it.

Functions have many other uses and we will show some of them in this lesson. But for now
we need to go back to the basics.

## Introduction

:::important Definition
A function is a separate piece of code that we can reuse many times.
:::

From the very beginning of our study, we included a special function in our programs,
which is `main`.

```cpp
int main() {
	// program code
}
```

A computer running a program finds the function `main` and then executes it,
passing each statement inside, line by line.

## Creating functions

We will start with the simplest features, gradually moving to more and more advanced features.

### Without parameters

<Image center border
		src="/img/tutorials/course/basic/functions/proc-no-params-en.png"
		desc="Scheme of the simplest function"
	/>

As we can see above, when defining our own function, we have to take care of its name and body, sticking to the
syntax. After the word `void` we write **function name**, then we put empty **parentheses**
(we'll talk about that later in this lesson), then **without a semicolon** we place below
block of code, which we call the **function body**.

:::important Naming
When naming a function, follow the same rules as for [variable names](../variables/#variable-name).
:::

Now we already have our function defined. This means that whenever we want to,
we can **call** it. We do it this way:

```cpp title="üîπ Calling the print function"
print();
```

:::caution
Note that we put a **semicolon** after the function call, because it's also the end of the statement.
:::

Let's write an example function that displays 10 even numbers and use it a few times:

<div>
	<Code_ExampleReuse />
</div>

### With parameters

<Image center border
		src="/img/tutorials/course/basic/functions/proc-params-en.png"
		desc="Scheme of a function with parameters"
	/>

The behavior of the function can depend on **parameters**. If you want the function to display
any number of even numbers, we can create a parameter in the function,
that will control it. A parameter is a variable inside the function, which we create
inside the parentheses

<div>
	<Code_ExampleReuseWithParam />
</div>

The above notation

```cpp
printEvenNumbers(10);
```

means that when called, the `howMany` parameter inside this function
will be assigned the value `10`. We can pass any number of parameters to the function.
Separate them by commas:

<div>
	<Code_ExampleReuseWithParams />
</div>

:::danger Common mistake
Notice that we place the function parameters after a comma, **each time specifying its type**.
A common mistake among beginners is omitting the type in the following parameters.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="‚ùå Bad" value="bad" default>

```cpp
void printBiggerNumber(int a, b)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="‚úî Good" value="good">

```cpp
void printBiggerNumber(int a, int b)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::

### Return statement

We can tell the program to return from a function earlier, using a statement:

```cpp
return;
```

Upon encountering it, the program stops executing further instructions in the function
and returns to the place from which it was called.
Let's recall the function we created earlier - `printEvenNumbers`

```cpp
void printEvenNumbers(int howMany)
{
	for (int i = 0; i < howMany; i++)
		std::cout << (i * 2) << ' ';
	std::cout << '\n';
}
```

What happens if we pass a negative number to `howMany`?

```cpp
printEvenNumbers(-10);
```

Executing a function with such a parameter value makes no sense, so we can detect this at
the very beginning and use the `return`:

```cpp
void printEvenNumbers(int howMany)
{
	if (howMany <= 0)
		return;

	for (int i = 0; i < howMany; i++)
		std::cout << (i * 2) << ' ';
	std::cout << '\n';
}
```

Now if we pass a value less than or equal to zero to a function parameter, the function will
be terminated at the beginning.

### Return value

<Image center border
		src="/img/tutorials/course/basic/functions/retval-params-en.png"
		desc="Schema of a function with parameters and return value"
	/>


Functions can produce a **result** after their execution. It will be easier to understand this if we use an analogy to
real life. Father sends his child to the store to buy 10 eggs. When the child returns, he will want to know,
whether the child managed to buy as many as he asked for or not. In the same way, we, performing some functions in code,
we want to know the result, the **return value**.

#### Return value type

It is required to specify what type the return value is. We specify it **before** the function name, example:

```cpp title="üîπ We return an integer" 
int sum(int from, int to)
```

```cpp title="üîπ No return value is produced"
void print(int number)
```

Notice that we have introduced a new type: `void`. If we write it in place of the return type,
it means that the function does not return a value, i.e. we do not need to know its result.
Note that we used `void` in the previous sections of this lesson for this very reason.

:::danger Void as a variable type
The `void` type cannot be used to create a variable:

```cpp title="‚ùå Illegal use"
void variable;
```

A variable inherently stores a value, which would be impossible if it were of type `void`.
:::

#### Usage

Let's implement the function from the diagram above. It is to count the sum of all numbers in the range `from` to `to` inclusive.

```cpp
int sum(int from, int to)
{
	int result = 0;
	for (int i = from; i <= to; i++)
		result += i;
	return result;
}
```

We can use the returned value, for example, by writing it to a variable:

```cpp title="üîπ Saving the result to a variable"
int s = sum(10, 100);
```

... or use in an expression (for example, as a function parameter):

```cpp title="üîπ Using a result"
std::cout << "Sum of the numbers in range [10; 100] equals: " << sum(10, 100);
```

#### Requirements

:::danger Returning a value is mandatory
A function that returns some value (anything other than a `void' type), **must** at the very end of its execution
return some value.

```cpp title="‚ùå Error: No value returned"
int sum(int from, int to)
{
	int result = 0;
	for (int i = from; i <= to; i++)
		result += i;
	// error-next-line
	// ‚ùå No return statement!
}
```

An exception is the `main` function, which, despite returning an `int` type,
performs an automatic return of a value `0` when `return` is omitted:

```cpp title="‚úî Acceptable"
int main() {
	// No "return" statement
}
```

We will say more about the `main` function in the future.

:::

### Declaration and definition

In order to use the above `sum` function, we need to make sure that it is **before** this use, for example:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="bad" label="‚ùå Bad" default>

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	// Error: used before the definition
	// error-next-line
	std::cout << "Sum of the numbers in range [10; 100] equals: " << sum(10, 100);
}

// highlight-next-line
int sum(int from, int to)
{
	int result = 0;
	for (int i = from; i <= to; i++)
		result += i;
	return result;
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="good" label="‚úî Good">

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int sum(int from, int to)
{
	int result = 0;
	for (int i = from; i <= to; i++)
		result += i;
	return result;
}

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Sum of the numbers in range [10; 100] equals: " << sum(10, 100);
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Making sure that the order always matches is troublesome and sometimes even impossible.
To fix the error in the above example, we have to use so called **function declaration**.

So far, when creating functions we used **function definition** which besides declaration,
also contains its entire implementation (body). Declaring a function looks like defining it,
**without providing its body**. We also need to take care to put a semicolon after the declaration.

<Columns columns={['1fr', '1fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="üîµ Definition"
int sum(int from, int to)
{
	int result = 0;
	for (int i = from; i <= to; i++)
		result += i;
	return result;
}
```

</div>
<div>

```cpp title="üü£ Declaration"
int sum(int from, int to);
```

</div>
</Columns>

The rule is that in order to use a function, it must be **declared** beforehand.
The definition must appear, but it does not matter if it is before or after the use.
Here are two examples:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="good" label="‚úî OK" default>

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// üü£ Declaration
// highlight-next-line
int sum(int from, int to);

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Sum of the numbers in range [10; 100] equals: " << sum(10, 100);
}

// üîµ Definition
// highlight-next-line
int sum(int from, int to)
{
	int result = 0;
	for (int i = from; i <= to; i++)
		result += i;
	return result;
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="good2" label="‚úî OK (definition before)">

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// üü£ Declaration
// highlight-next-line
int sum(int from, int to);

// üîµ Definition
// highlight-next-line
int sum(int from, int to)
{
	int result = 0;
	for (int i = from; i <= to; i++)
		result += i;
	return result;
}

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Sum of the numbers in range [10; 100] equals: " << sum(10, 100);
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="good3" label="‚úî OK (multiple decl.)">

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// üü£ Declarations
// highlight-start
int sum(int from, int to);
int sum(int from, int to); // OK, multiple declarations are acceptable
int sum(int from, int to); // but unnecessary ü§î
// highlight-end

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Sum of the numbers in range [10; 100] equals: " << sum(10, 100);
}

// üîµ Definition
// highlight-next-line
int sum(int from, int to)
{
	int result = 0;
	for (int i = from; i <= to; i++)
		result += i;
	return result;
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::danger The One Definition Rule (*ODR*)
The definition **must** appear in the code **only once** (there can be multiple declarations).
