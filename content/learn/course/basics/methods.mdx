# Methods

This lesson will show you how to place functions inside a structure, i.e. create so-called **methods**.

## Motivation

In programming, objects from real life are often mirrored, for example when creating a racing game 🏎
we will want to have vehicles that are defined by their

- **traits**, such as:
	- brand
	- model 🚘
	- max. speed 🚀
- **behaviour**, e.g:
	- acceleration 💨
	- braking 🛑

This way of describing objects, separating features and behaviors, is very common.
In the lesson on [structures](../structures) we learned how to contain different information
about objects within a single type that we created ourselves. In doing so, we described
its **traits**. Now we're going to move on to methods that will allow us to "teach" the object to
perform a specific task - define its **behaviour**. 

## Introduction

For the purposes of this lesson, let's create a structure that contains the features of a car:

```cpp
struct Car
{
	// car information
	std::string	brand;
	std::string	model;
	int			yearOfProduction;

	// movement
	float		topSpeed = 200;		// (km/h)
	float		acceleration = 50;	// (km/h per second)
	float		speed = 0;			// current one (km/h)
};
```

Inside the `main` function, let's create an object of this structure:

```cpp
int main()
{
	Car car;
	car.brand = "Ford";
	car.model = "Focus";
	car.yearOfProduction = 2010;

}
```

Now we will move on to how to make it (`car`) work.

## Creating and using methods

Inside the `Car` structure, at its end, let's put a function, named `accelerate`,
which will increase the `speed` by the acceleration value of the `acceleration`:

```cpp
struct Car
{
	// car information
	std::string	brand;	
	// ...

	// method that increases the speed
	// highlight-next-line
	void accelerate()
	{
		speed += acceleration;
	}
};
```

:::important Definition
**Methods** are called functions that belong to structures (or classes, which you will learn about later in the course).
:::

A method created this way can be called on an object, like this:

<Columns columns={['2fr', '1fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="🔹 Calling the accelerate()"
// ...

int main()
{
	Car car;
	// initial values...

	// calling for the first time
	// highlight-next-line
	car.accelerate();
	std::cout << "Current speed: " << car.speed << " km/h\n";
	// calling for the second time
	// highlight-next-line
	car.accelerate();
	std::cout << "Current speed: " << car.speed << " km/h\n";
}
```

</div>
<div>

```plaintext title="Result"
Current speed: 50 km/h
Current speed: 100 km/h
```

</div>
</Columns>

We give the name of the object that is to do the given thing, then after the dot
we give the method name and parameters - just like when calling a normal function.

<Columns columns={['1fr', '1fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="🔸 Calling a method"
object.methodName(arguments);
```

</div>
<div>

```cpp title="🔹 Calling a function"
functionName(arguments);
```

</div>
</Columns>

### Definition order

Inside a structure, methods need not be defined before declaring a variable or another method,
which also belongs to this structure:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="good1" label="✔ Good" default>

Note the order in which the methods are defined: `limitSpeed` was used in `accelerate`,
even though its definition is below. Similarly, the `speed` and `acceleration` fields
have been used before their declaration, because it is in the code **under** this usage.
This is allowed within the structure.

```cpp
struct Car
{
	// function that increases the speed
	void accelerate()
	{
		speed += acceleration;
		limitSpeed();
	}

	void limitSpeed() {
		if (speed > topSpeed)
			speed = topSpeed;
	}

	// class data members
	float topSpeed = 200;
	float acceleration = 50;
	float speed = 0;
	// the rest...
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="good2" label="✔ Good (order kept)">

The order of functions and variables is set according to their usage - also correct.

```cpp
struct Car
{
	// class data members
	float topSpeed = 200;
	float acceleration = 50;
	float speed = 0;
	// the rest...

	void limitSpeed() {
		if (speed > topSpeed)
			speed = topSpeed;
	}

	// function that increases the speed
	void accelerate()
	{
		speed += acceleration;
		limitSpeed();
	}
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="bad" label="❌ Bad">

Outside of a structure, such reordering is not allowed without using a separate declaration:

```cpp
void printHelloWorld()
{
	// ❌ Error, using `world` function before definition
	// error-next-line
	std::cout << "Hello, " << world();
}

// Return the "World!" string
std::string world()
{
	return "World!";
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Declaration and definition

As with functions, we can separate the method declaration and definition.
This way we are able to move their definitions outside of the structure body:

```cpp
struct Car
{
	// class data members
	float topSpeed = 200;
	float acceleration = 50;
	float speed = 0;
	// the rest...

	// Methods declarations:
	// highlight-start
	void limitSpeed();
	void accelerate();
	// highlight-end
};

// highlight-next-line
void Car::limitSpeed()
{
	if (speed > topSpeed)
		speed = topSpeed;
}

// highlight-next-line
void Car::accelerate()
{
	speed += acceleration;
	limitSpeed();
}
```

Note that in this case, we precede the method name with the structure name `Car`,
and a double colon `::`, the so-called *scope resolution operator*.

```cpp title="🔹 Definition outside the structure body scheme"
type StructureName::methodName(parameters)
{
	// ...
}
```

One of the advantages of this notation is the ability to separate the *interface*
of the structure from its *implementation*. This way, once you've implemented
methods, each time you look at the structure, you will only see the set of
variable and method names that you will use, without getting distracted by the
implementation details.

This notation is also crucial when splitting the code into multiple files - we'll tell
about it further on in the course.
