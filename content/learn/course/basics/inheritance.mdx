In this lesson you will learn how to use inheritance in order to share properties and characteristic from other classes by building class hierarchy and prevent redundant code. 

## Motivation 

When creating data structures that mimic real world elements, we often encounter situation when two such structures share common properties. For an example if we make game with vehicles containing planes âœˆ and cars ðŸš—, we would create two structures like this:

```cpp
struct Car
{
    // highlight-next-line
    std::string brand;
    // highlight-next-line
    std::string model;
    // highlight-next-line
    int productionYear;

    bool isCabrio;
};

struct Airplane
{
    // highlight-next-line
    std::string brand;
    // highlight-next-line
    std::string model;
    // highlight-next-line
    int productionYear;

    int enginesNumber;
    std::string airlinesName;
};
```

Note the highlighted lines. After a brief analysis we can spot, that both structures share these common properties:

- brand
- model
- production year

Later in this lesson we will use inheritance to 

## Base structure

Now when we pointed out common properties we can create structure that will consist only of these fields:

```cpp
struct Vehicle
{
    std::string brand;
    std::string model;
    int productionYear;
};
```

Note the name - Vehicle. It's a structure describing general form of the vehicle. Creating an instance of such structure doesn't have much sense: 

```cpp
Vehicle vehicle;
```

:::caution `Vehicle` instance
The above code is not prohibited. It won't cause compilation error. In the future we will learn how to prevent others from creating an instance of such object by using *private constructors*.
:::

Instead of this, we will use `Vehicle` to make `Car` and `Airplane` structures so they **inherit** its properties.

## Derived structures

In order to create **derived structres** using inheritance, we have to put the base structure name after the colon:

```cpp
struct Car : Vehicle
{
    bool isCabrio;
};

struct Airplane : Vehicle
{
    int enginesNumber;
    std::string airlinesName;
}
```

:::danger The order of definitions
We have to place the `Vehicle` definition before the derived structures definitions.

### Usage

<!-- English version of inheritance image needed -->

The above scheme shows, that properties inherited from `Vehicle` are in both `Car` and `Airplane` structures.

Because of this, when we create a car inside our code, we can use `brand`, `model` and `productionYear` fields as if they were directly in `Car` structure:

```cpp
Car ford;
ford.brand = "Ford";
ford.model = "Fiesta";
ford.productionYear = 2010;
ford.isCabrio = false;
```

The same applies to the plane:

```cpp
Airplane boeing;
boeing.brand = "Boeing";
boeing.model = "737";
boeing.productionYear = 2010;
boeing.enginesNumber = 2;
boeing.arilinesName = "Air Canada";
```

            <FullCode_DerivedStructsUsage />
        </CustomCodeBlock>
    </div>
</details>

### Inheriting methods

Just like member variables, methods are also inherited. Let's add `completeName()` method to the `Vehicle` class which will return the name consisiting of `brand` and `model`:

```cpp
struct Vehicle 
{
    // ... 

    std::string completeName() 
    {
        return brand + " " + model;
    }
};
```

Now we can use this method on the `Car` instance:

```cpp
Car ford;
ford.brand = "Ford";
ford.model = "Fiesta";

std::cout << ford.completeName(); // "Ford Fiesta"
```
