# Variables

In this lesson, we'll talk about how to store different values while a program
is running, that is, how to use variables.

## Motivation

To understand what they are useful for, let's write a program that raises a number
to the third power and then displays it:

<Columns spacing={40} columns={['8fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="🔹 main.cpp | Power of three"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << 212 * 212 * 212;
}
```

</div>

<div>

```plaintext title="Result (console)"
9528128
```

</div>
</Columns>

If we now want to raise a different number to the third power, we will have
to change three places in the code. It is tedious.

## Introduction

In order not to change so many things every time, let's assume for a moment
that the number we are raising to the power of three is called `x`.
What will the code look like then?

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	std::cout << x * x * x;
}
```

The above program at this stage **will not compile**. To use `x` in a calculation,
we first need to create a **variable** named `x`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	int x = 212;
	std::cout << x * x * x;
}
```

The above program will compile and run correctly.

:::important Variable definition
A **variable** is a container for data of a certain type.
:::

## Creating variables

In the above program, we created the variable like this:

```cpp
int x = 212;
```

Here is a diagram of this notation:

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="creation-init" label="🔢 With initial value" default>
		<Image center maxheight={250}
				src="/img/tutorials/course/basic/variables/creation-init-en.png"
				alt="Scheme for creating a variable (with initialization)"
			/>
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="creation" label="⚪ Without value">
		<Image center maxheight={250}
				src="/img/tutorials/course/basic/variables/creation-en.png"
				alt="Scheme for creating a variable (without initialization)"
			/>
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This <u>extremely important</u> notation consists of the following elements:

Element | Description
---|---
**`int`** | variable type
`x` | variable name
`= 212` | **initialization** (assignment of the initial value)
`;` | a semicolon that ends the statement

### Variable type

The type of a variable tells you what the variable can store. As mentioned before,
a variable is a container that holds certain things of a **certain type**.

`int` is an abbreviation of the word *integer* that is, a number without the fractional part.

At this stage, you should remember the following types of variables:

Type | Description
--- | ---
**`int`** | integer
**`float`** | real number (with fractional part)
**`char`** | a single character
**`bool`** | boolean value, i.e. `true` or `false`

We will cover more types and facts about them in the future.

:::danger
The above-mentioned types of variables are always written with **lowercase letters**. It matters.
:::

#### Examples of creating variables:

<hr/>

<Tabs>
	<TabItem value="int" label={<code>int</code>} default>

```cpp
// Without initialization
// Variable will contain an unpredictable value
int x;

// We create a variable and assign the 30 value to it
int y = 30;
```


	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="float" label={<code>float</code>}>

```cpp
// Without initialization
// Variable will contain an unpredictable value
float x;

// We create a variable and assign the 30 value to it
float y = 30;

// We create a variable and assign the 1.234 value to it
float z = 1.234f;
```

:::caution Fractional part
When we assign a value with a fractional part to a variable of type `float`,
we must end the number with the `f` character:

- ✔ `12.45f`
- ❌ `12.45`

This has its justification, but more on that later.
:::

	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="char" label={<code>char</code>}>

```cpp
// Without initialization
// Variable will contain an unpredictable value
char x;

// We create a variable and assign the 'j' character to it
char y = 'j';
```

:::danger Characters
Single characters are **always** written between <u>single quotes</u>.
- character: `'c'`
- a **string of characters**, consisting of 1 character: `"c"`

Therefore:
- ✔ `char x = 'c';`
- ❌ `char x = "c";`
:::

	</TabItem>
	<TabItem value="bool" label={<code>bool</code>}>

```cpp
// Without initialization
// Variable will contain an unpredictable value
bool x;

// We create a variable and assign the "true" value to it
bool y = true;

// We create a variable and assign the "false" value to it
bool z = false;
```

	</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<hr/>

### Variable name

The name can be anything you want, with some important restrictions:

- ❌ must not have spaces (prohibited: ❌ `abc def`)
- ✔ may consist of:
	- ✔ characters `a`-`z` and `A`-`Z`
	- ✔ digits, but not at the beginning (prohibited: ❌ `932abc`)
	- ✔ underscore `_`

You can create as many variables as you want, but they must have different names
as they are their unique identifiers (with some exceptions, but more on that later).

Case of the letters is important, variable names are case-sensitive:

```cpp
int x = 30;
float X = 12.34f;
```

In the code above, the variables `x` and `X` are two different variables!

:::tip Good practice (for non-english speakers)
It's best to use **only** English names, for example:
```cpp
float average;
```

instead of:

```cpp
float srednia; // average in Polish
```
:::

### Initialization (initial value)

Initialization is an optional step in creating variables. When we create it, we can
either leave it without the desired value:

```cpp
int x;
```

or assign it an initial value:

```cpp
int x = 30;
```

:::caution NO INITIALIZATION
An uninitialized variable, inside a function block (e.g. inside `main`) will initially have
an unpredictable value, it won't be reset to 0.

Leaving a variable without its initial value can cause problems later in the code.
Sometimes, however, we may intentionally skip it, but more on that later.
:::

### Semicolon at the end

Just a remainder 😀

```cpp
int name = 40;
```

## Opportunities

Variables hold values ​​for the duration of their existence (more on that later).
We can write values ​​to them or read them, display them on the screen, compare, etc.

### Simple interaction with the user

Our programs will be a bit more interesting when we let the user type
something into the console.  
We will do by adding a new instruction using `cin` (<i>**c**haracter **in**put</i>):

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Please enter your age: ";
	
	int age;
	// highlight-next-line
	std::cin >> age;

	std::cout << "You're " << age << " years old.\n";
}
```

`cin` allows us to save the content of the so-called standard input (stdin)
to the variable that is passed after the characters `>>`.

We'll talk about standard input another time, for now remember that `cin`
allows the program user to type something from the console,
and then assigns that value to a variable.

Please not that:
- `cout` uses the `<<` operator
- `cin` uses the `>>` operator

In addition to that, you can see that we didn't assign an initial value to `age`.
It is not needed, because immediately after its creation, we use `std::cin`
that assings the value that the user enters from the keyboard.

:::tip Remember
You can remember the direction of the stamps in this operator in an easy way

- `cout` - the text goes **to the console** - `<<` pointing to the `cout`
- `cin` -  the text goes **to the variable** - `>>` pointing to the variable
:::

### Simple math operations

Variables that contain numbers can be freely modified using typical mathematical signs (operators):

- `a + b` - adds two numbers together
- `a - b` - subtracts two numbers from each other
- `a * b` - multiplies two numbers by itself
- `a / b` - divides the number `a` by `b`

:::note
These are not all math operators, we'll talk about the rest later.
:::

Let's use these operators in practice:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Please enter your age: ";

	int age;
	std::cin >> age;

	// highlight-start
	std::cout << "In 10 years, you'll be "					<< (age + 10)	<< " years old\n";
	std::cout << "5 years ago, you were "					<< (age - 5)	<< " years old\n";
	std::cout << "When you are twice as old, you'll be "	<< (age * 2)	<< " years old\n";
	std::cout << "Someone twice as young is "				<< (age / 2)	<< " years old";
	// highlight-end
}
```

:::tip Alignment
Note that for the sake of better readability of the code, we've used the **`Tab`** key
to align the code after `<<` operator.
:::

A very important fact is that the use of the above-mentioned operators
**does not change the content of the variable** `age`.

By entering the age `20`, we will get the following result:

<Columns columns={['8fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```plaintext title="Console"
In 10 years, you'll be 30 years old
5 years ago, you were 15 years old
When you are twice as old, you'll be 40 years old
Someone twice as young is 10 years old
```

</div>

<div>

```plaintext title="Description"
(age: 20 => + 10 = 30)
(age: 20 => - 5 = 30)
(age: 20 => * 2 = 40)
(age: 20 => / 2 = 10)
```

</div>
</Columns>

As we can see, the value of the variable `age` remained the same at each stage (having value of `20`).  
This is because in the notation:

```cpp
a + b
```

the `a + b` expression **results** in some value and the contents of the **variables are left untouched**.  
If, for example, we want to increase a variable by `10`, we have to assign the result value of this expression to it:

```cpp
age = age + 10;
```

... or in short:

```cpp
age += 10;
```

See how it works on an example (I type `20` into the console again):

<Columns columns={['8fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

<CustomCodeBlock lineNumbers>

```cpp title="🔹 main.cpp"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Please enter your age: ";

	int age;
	std::cin >> age;

	std::cout << "You're now " << age << " years old\n";
	// highlight-start
	age += 30;
	std::cout << "In 30 years, you'll be " << age << " years old";
	// highlight-end
}
```

</CustomCodeBlock>

</div>

<div>

```plaintext title="Result"
You're now 20 years old
In 30 years, you'll be 50 years old
```

</div>
</Columns>

### Program execution flow

Variable `age`:

- when the line `11` is executed, it has the value `20`.
- in the line it `12` changes the value to `20 + 30` that is `50`
- on the line `13` is already displayed with the value `50`

### Modifying variables

In addition to the operator presented above: `+=`, there are many other operators available
that modify the content of variables.

The easiest way to show them is an example:

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="presentation" label="Presentation" default>

Below is a presentation of the program's operation, after entering the number `20`.

	int number;
	std::cin >> number;

	// Increase "number" by 5 and assign.
	number += 5;
	std::cout << "After increasing by 5: " << number << '\n';

	// Decrease "number" by 10 and assign.
	number -= 10;
	std::cout << "Then, after decreasing by 10: " << number << '\n';

	// Multiply by 3 and assign.
	number *= 3;
	std::cout << "Then, after multiplying by 3: " << number << '\n';

	// Divide by 2 and assign.
	number /= 2;
	std::cout << "Then, after dividing by 2: " << number << '\n';

	// Increase value by 1 (incrementation):
	number++;
	std::cout << "Then, after incrementation: " << number << '\n';

	// Decrease value by 1 (decrementation):
	number--;
	std::cout << "Then, after decrementation: " << number << '\n';
}
```

</CustomCodeBlock>
</TabItem>
