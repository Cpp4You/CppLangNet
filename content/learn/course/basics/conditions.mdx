# Conditions (if, else)

So far, we've been creating programs that worked the same way every time. It is boring.
In this lesson we will make our program react to what the user enters.

We will make an application that checks if the user can legally get drivers license 😎
(is at least 18 years old in most countries).

## Code preparation

To begin with, let's ask user for year of birth:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "PROGRAM TESTING IF YOU CAN LEGALLY DRIVE\n";

	std::cout << "Please enter your age: ";

	int yearOfBirth;
	std::cin >> yearOfBirth;

	// Year 2021 at the moment of writing this lesson
	int age = 2021 - yearOfBirth;

	// highlight-start
	// Case A:
	std::cout << "You can legally get a driver's license\n";
	// highlight-end

	// highlight-start
	// Case B:
	std::cout << "You cannot legally get a driver's license\n";
	// highlight-end
}
```

Above I have marked two pieces of code that should execute depending on the value of the variable age.

- case A (legal) - when it `age` is greater than or equal to `18`
- case B (illegal) - when it `age` is less than `18`

How do I do this in C++?

## Conditional statements

In C++, we have several kinds of conditional statements. For now, we will focus on
the simplest and most basic of them:

- `if`
- `else`

Let's see how it works on the example of the code prepared above:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "PROGRAM TESTING IF YOU CAN LEGALLY DRIVE\n";

	std::cout << "Please enter your age: ";

	int yearOfBirth;
	std::cin >> yearOfBirth;

	// Year 2021 at the moment of writing this lesson
	int age = 2021 - yearOfBirth;

	// highlight-start	
	if (age >= 18) 
	{
		// Case A:
		std::cout << "You can legally get a driver's license";
	}
	else
	{
		// Case B:
		std::cout << "You cannot legally get a driver's license";
	}
	// highlight-end
}
```

After the `if` keyword, we write condition in parentheses.
Next, we create a **code block** that will execute <u>if the condition is true</u>.

After that, we can <u>optionally</u> put `else` along with a block of code
that will execute when the condition that we put in `if` is <u>not satisfied</u>.

:::danger No semicolon `;`

Don't put semicolon (`;`) after the parentheses of the `if` statement.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="right" label="✔ Right" default>

```cpp
if (age >= 18) 
// ...
else
// ...
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="wrong" label="❌ Wrong">

```cpp
if (age >= 18);
// ...
else;
// ...
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::

When we want `if` or `else` to execute only one instruction, we can use the notation
without code blocks - that is, we do not write the braces `{` and `}`:


```cpp
if (age >= 18) 
	std::cout << "You can legally get a driver's license"; // Case A
else
	std::cout << "You cannot legally get a driver's license"; // Case B
```

## Boolean expressions

Inside the parenthesis of `if` we enter a **logical expression**, i.e. one whose result
is either `true` or `false`.

`age >= 18` is a logical expression that is `true`, when `age` is greater than or equal to `18`.
Otherwise the result of the expression is `false`.

### Logical operators

We used the `>=` logical operator above. Apart from it, we also have others in C++.

They use almost identical notation to mathematics, except that

> ... *or equal to*

is obtained by adding `=` to the **right side** of `>` or `<` sign.
Here are some of the most important ones:

| C++ operator | Math equivalent | Description |
| -------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| `a > b` | a &gt; b | `a` greater than `b` |
| `a >= b` | a ≥ b | `a` greater than or equal to `b` |
| `a < b` | a &lt; b | `a` less than `b` |
| `a <= b` | a ≤ b | `a` less than or equal to `b` |


And two even more important operators:

| C++ operator | Math equivalent | Description |
| -------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| `a == b` | a = b | `a` equal to `b` |
| `a != b` | a ≠ b | `a` not equal to `b` |

:::danger
Inside `if` parentheses, to check whether `a` is equal to `b`, we use `==`
operator (notice the double equal sign).

The following code:
```cpp
if (a = b)
{
	// ...
}
```
**DOES NOT WORK** the way you may think. We'll talk about it later,
for this moment always make sure you use:

- ✔ `if (a == b)`
- ❌ `if (a = b)`

:::

#### Negation operator

An interesting case is the negation operator, which is **unary**.
This means that it only operates on a single expression.
Let's see it on an example:

```cpp title="🔹 Negation operator"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "PROGRAM TESTING IF YOU CAN LEGALLY DRIVE\n";

	std::cout << "Please enter your age: ";

	int yearOfBirth;
	std::cin >> yearOfBirth;

	// Year 2021 at the moment of writing this lesson
	int age = 2021 - yearOfBirth;

	// highlight-next-line	
	if (!(age >= 18)) 
		std::cout << "You cannot legally get a driver's license"; // Case B
	else
		std::cout << "You can legally get a driver's license"; // Case A
}
```

Negation changes the value of an expression from `true` to `false` or
from `false` to `true`. We took the whole expression `age >= 18` in parentheses above
and negated it, by using an exclamation point **before** the expression:

```cpp
!(age >= 18)
```

So this expression is in fact equivalent to:

```cpp
age < 18
```

### Combining conditions

We can also combine several conditions with each other:

```cpp
if (age >= 18 and age <= 30)
{
	std::cout << "You can get a driver license, but you're not over 30 years old.";
}
```

```cpp
if (age <= 6 or age > 60)
{
	std::cout << "For kids under the age of 6 and people over 60 tickets are free - you can enter for free";
}
```

When used inside `if`:

- `and` - requires that both expressions - on its left and right side, are true
- `or` - requires that at least one expression - on its left or right side, be true

You can also combine more logical expressions like this:

```cpp
if (age > 5 and age < 15 or age > 60)
{

}
```

Then you have to consider the **operator priority**, which is the order in which it will be checked.

The operator `and` has a higher priority than `or`, so when analyzing this expression,
the computer considers it first, only later `or`. If you have trouble understanding this,
you can imagine that the computer kind of adds parentheses around expressions `L and P`,
and as you already know from math, **whatever is in parentheses is more important**.

The above code will work the same as this one:

```cpp
if ( (age > 5 and age < 15) or age > 60 )
{

}
```

... that is, it will check whether:

- the age is in the range (5, 15)

**or**

- age is greater than 60

:::caution
In programming, words `and`, `or` are used rarely.
Developers more often use their counterparts in the form of:

- `&&` instead of `and`
- `||` instead of `or`

Their behavior is identical and we will use them later in the course.
:::

### `bool` type

The data type `bool` is used to store Boolean values - `true` and `false`.

Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Please enter your year of birth: ";
	std::cin >> yearOfBirth;

	int age = 2021 - yearOfBirth;

	// highlight-next-line
	bool isAdult = age >= 18;

	// highlight-next-line
	if (isAdult)
		std::cout << "You can get a driver license.";
	else
		std::cout << "You're not allowed to get a driver license yet.";
}
```

The result of the expression `age >= 18` (either `true` or `false`) is assigned
to a variable `isAdult`. Then, if `isAdult` is true, we'll see the following text
in the console:

```
You can get a driver license.
```

otherwise:

```
You're not allowed to get a driver license yet.
```

By using the negation operator on a variable of type `bool`, we can easily toggle its state:

```cpp
bool isButtonPressed = true; // 👍

isButtonPressed = !isButtonPressed; // changes from true 👍 to false 👎
isButtonPressed = !isButtonPressed; // now it changes from false 👎 to true 👍

isButtonPressed = !!isButtonPressed; // double negation -> no effect
```

## Compound conditional statements

Suppose we want to sell pool tickets at different prices depending on age.
Here are the criteria:

- children under 6: free
- persons aged 6 to 17 inclusive: $4
- adults up to 59 years of age inclusive: $8
- people from 60 years of age: $6

We will use a `else if` construct to check the following conditions:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "SWIMMING POOL - TICKETS\n";
	std::cout << "Please enter your age: ";

	int age;
	std::cin >> age;

	if (age < 6)
		std::cout << "You can enter for free";
	// highlight-next-line
	else if (age <= 17)
		std::cout << "Ticket price: $4";
	// highlight-next-line
	else if (age <= 59)
		std::cout << "Ticket price: $8";
	else
		std::cout << "Ticket price: $6";
}
```

Meeting the condition in any one of `if`s (including `else if`s) interrupts a further checking
of next `else if` statements.

:::important
Neither `else if`, nor `else` is even taken into account when one of the previous `if`s or `else if`s
condition in the chain was evaluated to `true`.
