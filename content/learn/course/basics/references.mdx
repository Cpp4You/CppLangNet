# References
This lesson will show you how you can access variables indirectly with references.

## Motivations
Let's say that you have a function that doubles the parameter.

<Columns spacing={40} columns={['7fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void doubleNumber(int num) 
{
    num = num * 2;
}

int main()
{
    int x = 5;
    doubleNumber(x); 
    std::cout << x;
}
```

</div>

<div>

```plaintext title="Output (console)"
5
```

</div>
</Columns>

But this will not work,
because only the value of `x` is written into `num`.

This is where references come into play.


## Using references
You can create a reference by adding a `&` to the type of the variable you want to refer to.
```cpp
int var = 5;
int& ref = var; // ref is a int reference that refers to var
```
Now, if you modify `ref`, `var` will also be modified because `ref` **is** `var`.
```cpp
ref = 23;
std::cout << var; // Prints out 23
```


## Pass by reference
Now let's see how we can use references to solve our issue.

We just need to make the function take a `int reference` instead of `int`.
<Columns spacing={40} columns={['7fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void doubleNumber(int &num) 
{
    num = num * 2;
}

int main()
{
    int x = 5;
    doubleNumber(x);
}
```

</div>

<div>

```plaintext title="Output (console)"
10
```

</div>
</Columns>

Now the the function `doubleNumber` takes a reference,
`num` will become whatever variable is passed into the function.
This means when we modify num (which has become `x`), we also indirectly modify `x`.


## Modifying elements in a range-based for loop
A similar problem can be seen in range-based for loops.
Since references **become** the variable that it is referring to,
we can use it to access the elements in our arrays.

Here is a simple array
```cpp
std::vector<int> arr = {2, 4, 6};
```

Let's say we want to add 5 to each element,
It's possible to do that one by one, but it becomes annoying and long if the array is big. <br/>
So loops will come to our rescue!

<Columns spacing={40} columns={['7fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp
for (int x : arr) 
{
    x = x + 5;
}
std::cout << arr[0];
```

</div>

<div>

```plaintext title="Output (console)"
2
```

</div>
</Columns>

But the code above will unfortunately not work.
This is because only the value of the element is being copied into `x`,
not the element itself.

This is where we can use references,
they can make the actual element of the array be copied into `x`.
<Columns spacing={40} columns={['7fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp
for (int& x : arr) 
{
    x = x + 5;
}
std::cout << arr[0];
```

</div>

<div>

```plaintext title="Output (console)"
7
```
</div>
</Columns>
Now each each element of the array has successfully increased by five.

:::note Use references accordingly
You should only use references for when you actually need to modify the variable.
Don't use references if you just need the value.
