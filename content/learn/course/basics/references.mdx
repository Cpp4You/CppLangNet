# References
References are a way to refer to a variable.
When you create a reference to a variable, it becomes the variable itself.

## Motivations
Let's say that you have a function that doubles the parameter.
```cpp
void doubleNumber(int num) 
{
num = num * 2;
}

int main()
{
int x = 5;
doubleNumber(x); // x will still be 5!
}
```
But this will not work,
because only the value of `x` is written into `num`.

This is where references come into play.

## Using references
You can create a reference by adding a `&` to the type of the variable you want to refer to.
```cpp
int var = 5;
int& ref = x; // ref is a int reference that refers to var
```
Now, if you modify `ref`, `var` will also be modified because `ref` **is** `var`.
```cpp
ref = 23;
std::cout << var; // Prints out 23
```

## Modifying elements in a range-based for loop
Since references **become** the variable that it is referring to,
we can use it to access the elements in our arrays.

Here is a simple array
```cpp
std::vector<int> arr(3);
arr[0] = 2;
arr[1] = 4;
arr[2] = 6;
```

Let's say we want to add 5 to each element,
It's possible to do that one by one, but it becomes annoying and long if the array is big. <br/>
So loops will come to our rescue!

```cpp
for (int x : arr) 
{
x = x + 5;
}
// Elements remain unchanged after this loop
```
But the code above will unfortunately not work.
This is because only the value of the element is being written into `x`,
not the element itself.

This is where references come in,
they can make the actual element of the array be written into `x`.
```cpp
for (int& x : arr) 
{
x = x + 5;
}
```
Now each each element of the array has successfully be increased by five.

## Pass by reference
Function parameters have a similar issue.
They also only copy the value and not the variable itself,
so you can't modify the actual variable.
```cpp
void double(int x) 
{
x = x * 2; 
}
```

This again, can be solved with references:

```cpp
void double(int& x) 
{
x = x * 2; 
}
```

:::note Use references accordingly
You should only use references for when you actually need to modify the variable.
Don't use references if you just need the value.
