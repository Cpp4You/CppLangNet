# References

:::note Add a page about pointers
It is difficult to understand references before pointers.

References are very similar to pointers.
But the difference is that references cannot refer to something else, or refer to nothing.
A reference to a variable is basically "another name" for that variable.

## Motivations
The most common use case for references is `pass by reference`.

Pass by reference means to take function parameters by "the variable itself".
Normally when functions take parameters, it'll copy the value of the parameters,
also known as `pass by value`

Here is an example:
```cpp
void PlusOne(int num) 
{
    num = num + 1; // Add 1 to num
}

int main() 
{
    int x = 5;
    PlusOne(x);
    std::cout << x;
}
```

Expected output:
```
6
```

Actual output:
```
5
```

And this is all due to *pass by value*. Only the value of `x` was taken in by the `PlusOne`.
So `x` itself was not changed at all.

### Fixing the function with pass by reference
Here is how you can use pass by reference to get the result you want:
```cpp
void PlusOne(int& num) 
{
    num = num + 1;
}

int main() 
{
    int x = 5;
    PlusOne(x);
    std::cout << x;
}
```

Now it outputs the expected:
```
6
```

:::important Prefer references over pointers
Pointers can change target and point to null, references are much safer.
Always use references unless a pointer is needed.
