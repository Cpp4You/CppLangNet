# Simple calculator

Requires knowledge of: [**1. First program**](../../first-program) - [**4. Conditions**](../../conditions)

## Overview

A simple program that allows you to calculate:

- âž• a sum
- âž– a difference
- âœ– a product
- âž— a quotient

of two real numbers.

## Source code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout	<< "=== CALCULATOR ===\n"
				<< "Menu:\n"
				<< "1) Add\n"
				<< "2) Subtract\n"
				<< "3) Multiply\n"
				<< "4) Divide\n"
				<< "> Your choice: ";

	int choice;
	std::cin >> choice;

	float a, b;
	if (choice == 1)
	{
		std::cout	<< "Calculating a sum (a + b).\n"
					<< "Please enter the first number: ";
		std::cin >> a;

		std::cout	<< "Please enter the second number: ";
		std::cin >> b;

		std::cout << "a + b equals " << (a + b);
	}
	else if (choice == 2)
	{
		std::cout	<< "Calculating a difference (a - b).\n"
					<< "Please enter the first number: ";
		std::cin >> a;

		std::cout	<< "Please enter the second number: ";
		std::cin >> b;

		std::cout << "a - b equals " << (a - b);
	}
	else if (choice == 3)
	{
		std::cout	<< "Calculating a product (a * b).\n"
					<< "Please enter the first number: ";
		std::cin >> a;

		std::cout	<< "Please enter the second number: ";
		std::cin >> b;

		std::cout << "a * b equals " << (a * b);
	}
	else if (choice == 4)
	{
		std::cout	<< "Calculating a quotient (a / b).\n"
					<< "Please enter the first number: ";
		std::cin >> a;

		std::cout	<< "Please enter the second number: ";
		std::cin >> b;

		if (b == 0)
			std::cout << "Cannot divide by 0!";
		else
			std::cout << "a / b equals " << (a / b);
	}
	else
		std::cout << "Invalid option: " << choice;
}
```

## Explaination

<ImproveSection />

### 1. Main menu

`cout` is used to print the main program menu at the
very beginning <small>([*Lesson - 1. First program*](../../first-program))</small>.
We chained a multiple text printings using `<<` operators.

### 2. Choice

To determine which math operation should be executed we use `if`, `else if`
and `else` statements <small>([*Lesson - 4. Conditions*](../../conditions))</small>

## Things to improve

### 1. Repeating code

You can easily spot a piece of code that is repeated
several times:

```cpp title="âš  Repeated code fragment"
std::cout << "Please enter the first number: ";
std::cin >> a;

std::cout << "Please enter the second number: ";
std::cin >> b;
```

You'll learn how to solve this problem in the course,
by using [**functions**](../../functions).

### 2. Detecting input failures

What would happen if you tried to enter **a word**
(f.e.: `hello`) instead of a number in this part of the code:

```cpp title="ðŸ¤” Will it work?"
int choice;
std::cin >> choice; // entering "hello"
```

**`TODO`**: lesson about input reading failures
