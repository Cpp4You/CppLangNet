# Fixed-size arrays

In this lesson we'll briefly explain what is `std::array`. Later in the course you'll learn more about it.

## Motivation

We already have [vectors](/docs/std/containers/arrays/vector/), which represent a dynamic array, and we can use them to store any
number of elements. You may ask:

> Why do we even need arrays of fixed size?

The short answer is: **performance**.

:::important `array` vs `vector` vs C-style arrays
`std::array` is a more performant alternative to `std::vector`, but with a few limitations. It is also a much safer alternative to C-style arrays.
:::

We, the creators of this course are fully aware that for beginners a tiny performance improvement over `vector` is not worth the extra effort.
This container will be covered more in-depth later, when you'll be more familiar with C++.

## Using `std::array`

The first thing we have to do is to include the `<array>` header file:

```cpp
#include <array>
```

## Creating an array

There are [quite a few ways](/docs/std/containers/arrays/array/#example-usage) to create an instance of `std::array`.
Remember: we're talking about an array of **fixed-size** that we have to know in advance. We can't change the size of the array after it's created.
A common practice is to estimate the largest number of elements we'll use and then create an array of that size.

```cpp title="Allow up to 10 players in our game"
std::array<std::string, 10> player_names;
```

In the previous lesson we used similar notation to create `vector` instance. This time we have to provide both:

- the type of the elements (`Type`)
- the size of the array (`N`)

and we do that by separating them with a comma:

```cpp
// prism-push-types:Type
std::array<Type, N>
```

It's quite usual to initialize an array with some predefined values. We can do that by using the curly braces syntax:

```cpp title="Allow up to 10 players, provide three initial names"
std::array<std::string, 10> player_names = {
	"HappyBanana", "AngryCrab", "SadWolf",
};
```

<details>
<summary>Alternative syntax</summary>
<div>

You can omit the `=` between the `player_names` and the curly braces then wrap the list of elements
in an additional `{}` to achieve the same result:

```cpp
std::array<std::string, 10> player_names {{
	"HappyBanana", "AngryCrab", "SadWolf",
}};
```

</div>
</details>

:::important Elements we left unset in `{ }`
If you don't provide initial values for all elements, the remaining ones will be initialized with a default or zero value.
In simple terms, depending on the type inside an array: numeric values will be set to `0`, booleans to `false`, and strings will be empty.
:::

This is the content of the array after the previous code snippet:

| Index | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| 0 | "HappyBanana" |
| 1 | "AngryCrab" |
| 2 | "SadWolf" |
| 3 | empty |
| ... | ... |
| 9 | empty |

## Accessing elements

We can access elements of an array [the same way](../dynamic-arrays/#accessing-elements) we do with vectors:

```cpp title="Display the first player's name"
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <array>

int main()
{
    std::array< std::string, 10 > player_names = {
		"HappyBanana", "AngryCrab", "SadWolf"
	};

    // Setting names of the players
    player_names[0] = "SadBanana";
    player_names[2] = "HappyWolf";

    // Printing the name of the first player:
    std::cout << "Name of the first player: " << player_names[0];
}
```

We changed the first and the third element of the array. The output of the program is:

```console
Name of the first player: SadBanana
```

This is the content of the array after the previous code snippet:

| Index | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| 0 | "SadBanana" |
| 1 | "AngryCrab" |
| 2 | "HappyWolf" |
| 3 | empty |
| ... | ... |
| 9 | empty |

## Reading the size of an array

We can use the `size()` method to get the size of an array:

```cpp
std::array<std::string, 10> player_names = {
	"HappyBanana", "AngryCrab", "SadWolf",
};

std::cout << "Number of players: " << player_names.size();
```

The output of the program is:

```console
Number of players: 10
```

:::note Size of `std::array`
As you can see from the example above, all of array "slots" are used regardless of the number of elements we set manually.
The rest are initialized with default values, which in this case are empty strings.
:::

## Displaying elements

Just like we did with vectors, we can use a `for` loop to display all elements of an array:

```cpp title="Display all player names"
for (std::string name : player_names)
{
	std::cout << "Player: " << name << '\n';
}
```

<FullCode content={<FullCode_PrintPlayerNames/>} />

The output of the program is:

```console
Player: HappyBanana
Player: AngryCrab
Player: SadWolf
Player:
Player:
Player:
Player:
Player:
Player:
Player:
```

## Summary

To sum up, we've learned that there is a fixed-size array in C++ called `std::array`. In many cases we can use it similar to
a `vector`, however it has some limitations and it's not as flexible. Our recommendation for you is to stick with `std::vector`
for now.

We'll leave it here for now, but we'll come back to it later in the course.
