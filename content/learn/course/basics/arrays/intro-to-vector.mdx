# Introduction to `std::vector`

In this lesson, I will show you what arrays are and what they are for,
in their simplest form, using a [`std::vector`](/docs/std/containers/arrays/vector/).

## Motivation

Let's assume that we want to store the nicknames of players who are on the server.
Each name is essentially a text, so we will store it inside a variable
of type [`std::string`](/docs/std/containers/strings/string/).

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
	std::string playerName1;
	std::string playerName2;
	std::string playerName3;

	std::cout << "Please enter the name of player 1: ";
	std::cin >> playerName1;

	std::cout << "Please enter the name of player 2: ";
	std::cin >> playerName2;

	std::cout << "Please enter the name of player 3: ";
	std::cin >> playerName3;
}
```

Assuming we have three players on the server, we can construct a code like the one above.
In a situation where we want 5 players, we will have to play with the command
"copy -> paste" additional times. Repeating this is not a good idea.
Is there a tool that will allow us to shorten this code and not use "copy -> paste" as many times?

We will use **arrays** for this purpose.

## What is an array

<br/>

An array is a container that can store *some* number of elements of a certain type.
See the picture above. Inside the array are the names of the brands of the vehicles.
Note that each element has its own unique **index**.

There are fixed-size arrays that always contain the same number of elements,
and dynamic arrays that can grow and shrink as needed.

:::important Array indices
Elements of an array are indexed from zero upwards.
The first element has an index `0`, the second `1` etc.
:::

Indexes help distinguish between each element of an array.
With their help, we can use the elements in the code.

## Using arrays

In the code above in the [Motivation](#motivation) section,
we have great candidates to make one board out of them.

Variables

```cpp
std::string playerName1;
std::string playerName2;
std::string playerName3;
```

are of the same type (`std::string`) and differ only in number at the end of their name.
Instead of making three separate variables, we can create one array that contains three elements:

### Creating an array variable

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
// highlight-next-line
#include <vector> // necessary for std::vector usage

int main()
{
	// highlight-next-line
	std::vector< std::string > playerNames(3);
	// ...
}
```

To use a type `std::vector`, we need to add another one `#include`, this time:

```cpp
#include <vector>
```

`vector` is the so-called template, which means that it can be used with the different types,
which we specify in angle brackets, right after `std::vector`:

```cpp
std::vector< int >
std::vector< float >
std::vector< char >
std::vector< std::string >
std::vector< /*other type*/ >
```

But what does "vector of a given type" mean? This means that `std::vector< T >`
stores elements of type `T`.

Following code:

```cpp
std::vector< std::string > playerNames(3);
```

means that we are creating *variable of an array type* with a name `playerNames` that
stores text elements (`std::string`s).

A parenthesis with a three in the middle at the end of this notation:

```cpp
playerNames(3)
```

will make the vector store `3` variables of type `std::string` right from the beginning.

### Accessing elements

We can access an array element at any time using its index:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

int main()
{
	std::vector< std::string > playerNames(3);

	// Setting names of the players
	playerNames[0] = "HappyBanana";
	playerNames[1] = "AngryCrab";
	playerNames[2] = "SadWolf";

	// Printing the name of the first player:
	std::cout << "Name of the first player: " << playerNames[0];
}
```

:::important Array elements
To access an element of an array, we put its index in square brackets right after the array name:

```cpp
arrayName[ index ]
```

:::

### Adding items

At the moment, our array has `3` elements, with indices `0`, `1` and `2`:

| Index  | Name |
| ------ | ---- |
| 0      | HappyBanana |
| 1      | AngryCrab   |
| 2      | SadWolf     |

To add another item to the array, we need to use `push_back` like this:

```cpp title="ðŸ”¹ Adding an item to the array"
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

int main()
{
	std::vector< std::string > playerNames(3);

	// Setting names of the players
	playerNames[0] = "HappyBanana";
	playerNames[1] = "AngryCrab";
	playerNames[2] = "SadWolf";

	// Adding a new player:
	// highlight-next-line
	playerNames.push_back("WickedWitch");

	// Printing the name of player with index 3
	std::cout << "Name of the player with index 3: " << playerNames[3];
}
```

From the moment it was called `push_back`, the array `playerNames` already has four elements.
The above provision uses the so-called *method call `push_back()`*.
We'll talk more about *calls* and *methods* in the future.
For now, just remember that:

1. we put a dot after the name of the array
2. we write the name of the *method*, which is in this case `push_back`
3. then in parentheses we enter what we want to add (e.g. a value or a variable)

:::important Index range
Note that an array with the number of elements `N` always has indices from `0` to,
`N-1` inclusive. A four-element array `playerNames` has indices from `0` to, `3` inclusive.
:::

An attempt to write to an array with index `4` will result in an error:

```cpp title="ðŸ”´ Run-time error"
// error-next-line
playerNames[4] = "NewPlayer"; // Error
```

The reason is that the element with index `4` does not exist
(size is `4` but the last item has index `3`). This code will compile
correctly (we might get a warning), but running this program will result in an error.

### Reading the size

The current size of the array can be read using the method `size()`:

```cpp
// Setting names of the players
playerNames[0] = "HappyBanana";
playerNames[1] = "AngryCrab";
playerNames[2] = "SadWolf";

// highlight-next-line
std::cout << "The array contains " << playerNames.size() << " elements\n";

// Adding a new player:
playerNames.push_back("WickedWitch");
std::cout << "Added new player.\n";
// highlight-next-line
std::cout << "The array contains " << playerNames.size() << " elements\n";
```

As above with the method `push_back`, we write the name after the dot and then write
the parentheses, and in this case we leave them empty.

### Removing items

At this stage of learning, you will have to trust me a little.
I won't go into details because it's too complicated for now.
To remove the `n`-th element from a vector (e.g. from `playerNames`) we use the notation:

```cpp title="ðŸ”¹ Deleting n-th element from playerNames"
playerNames.erase( playerNames.begin() + n );
```

Simply put, `erase` removes a specific element, but the index itself is not enough.
We need to use `begin()` and add the index to it.

:::tip Remember
You can remember this by distinguishing between these two concepts:

- **index** (non-negative number)
- **position**

These are two different but thematically similar things. We have to pass to `erase`
the *position* that we get by adding the *index* to the *starting position* (`playerNames.begin()`).
:::

:::danger
Before you delete an item in an array, make sure it exists (that is, it's in scope `[0, N)`).

```cpp title="ðŸ”¹ Deleting n-th element from an array (safe)"
int index;
std::cin >> index;

if (index >= 0 && index < playerNames.size())
{
	playerNames.erase( playerNames.begin() + index );
}
else
	std::cout << "Index " << index << " does not exist!";
```

:::

### Displaying elements

If we want to display **all** the elements of an array, we'll have to use a *loop*.
We will tell more about loops in the future. They allow you to execute the same
piece of code multiple times.

```cpp title="ðŸ”¹ Displaying items"
for (std::string name : playerNames)
{
	std::cout << "Player name: " << name << '\n';
}
```

To understand this, let me show you how to "read" it:

> **For** <small>(`for`)</small> **each player name** <small>(`name`)</small>
> **which is of a type** `std::string` **in an array** `playerNames` **execute**
> **the following block of code**...

There is only one statement inside this block of code:

```cpp
std::cout << "Player name: " << name << '\n';
```
The loop will write the nicknames of the players one by one
into the variable `name`, and execute the display instruction (`cout`) for each of them.

:::tip Type deduction
**If you can easily guess** what type of elements the array stores,
you can shorten the notation:

```cpp
for (std::string name : playerNames)
```

to

```cpp
for (auto name : playerNames)
```

then the `auto` keyword will cause the item type to be detected automatically.
