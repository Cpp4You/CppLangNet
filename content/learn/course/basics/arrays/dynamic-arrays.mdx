# Dynamic arrays

In this lesson we'll learn how to use dynamic arrays in C++ using the `std::vector` type.

Let's go back and consider the code we've shown in the [Motivation](../introduction/#motivation) section of the previous lesson.
There is a great candidate to be turned into an array. The following variables are of the same type (`std::string`)
and differ only in number at the end of their name.

```cpp
std::string playerName1;
std::string playerName2;
std::string playerName3;
```

<FullCode content={<FullCode_Motivation/>} />

Instead of making three separate variables, we can create one array that contains three elements.

## Creating a vector

To use `std::vector` we first have to include its header file:

```cpp
#include <vector>
```

As we already know from the [Introduction](../introduction), to create a `vector` we have to know the type of the elements
that will be stored inside it. Keep in mind that all of the elements in a vector are of the same type.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string> // do not forget about string
#include <vector>

int main()
{
	// highlight-next-line
	std::vector< std::string > playerNames(3);
	// ...
}
```

The above example shows how to create a vector that stores `std::string`s.

:::tip Convenience
Before we continue, let's put an appropriate [`using` statement](/learn/course/basics/first-program/#prefix-of-the-standard-namespace)
at the beginning of the `main` function block to skip the `std::` prefix:

```cpp
int main() {
	// highlight-next-line
	using std::vector, std::string;

	vector< string > playerNames(3);
}
```

**Remember**: later we'll use more elements from the standard library, like `std::cout` and `std::cin`. Don't forget to add these
to the `using` statement.
:::

**vector** is a *template*, which means that it can be used with different types,
which we specify in angle brackets, right after `vector`, e.g:

```cpp title="🔹 Using vector with different types"
vector< int > arrayOfInts;
vector< float > arrayOfFloats;
vector< char > arrayOfChars;
vector< string > arrayOfStrings;
vector< /*other type*/ > arrayOfXYZ;
```

The following code defines a variable `playerNames`  of a vector type that stores text elements (`std::string`s):

```cpp title="Defining a variable of vector type"
vector< string > playerNames(3);
```

A parenthesis with 3 in the middle will make the vector store 3 variables, or more precisely, 3 elements
of type `string` right from the beginning.

```cpp title="Storing 3 elements in the vector"
playerNames(3)
```

Note that this is a vector-specific thing and not a general rule. If you want to create a vector that is initially empty,
just don't write the parentheses at all:

```cpp title="Creating an empty vector"
vector< string > playerNames;
```

:::danger Empty parentheses problem
A mistake that is often made by beginners is to write empty parentheses when creating a vector (or actually any other type):

```cpp title="This is not defining a variable"
vector< string > playerNames();
```

Later in the course you'll learn about **functions**, and the syntax that declares them:

```cpp title="This is actually a function declaration"
// prism-push-types:AnyType
AnyType functionName();
```

This is why the empty parentheses turns this into a function declaration, which is not what we want.

:::


## Accessing elements

Let's give players the following names:

| Player index  | Name |
| ------------- | ---- |
| 0             | HappyBanana |
| 1 		    | AngryCrab   |
| 2 		    | SadWolf     |

<br/>

Here is how we can set them in the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

int main()
{
	using std::vector, std::string, std::cout;

	vector< string > playerNames(3);

	// Setting names of the players
	playerNames[0] = "HappyBanana";
	playerNames[1] = "AngryCrab";
	playerNames[2] = "SadWolf";

	// Printing the name of the first player:
	cout << "Name of the first player: " << playerNames[0];
}
```

```console title="Output"
Name of the first player: HappyBanana
```

To access an element of an array, we put its index in square brackets right after the array name:

```cpp
arrayName[ index ]
```

A non-empty array with number of elements equal to `N` always has indices from `0` to,
`N-1` inclusive. A three-element array `playerNames` has indices from `0` to, `2` inclusive.
An attempt to rename the player with index `3` will result in a runtime error:

```cpp title="🔴 Run-time error"
// error-next-line
playerNames[3] = "NewPlayer"; // Error
```

The reason is that the element with index `3` does not exist (size is `3` but the last item has index `2`).
This code will compile correctly (we might get a warning), but running this program will result in an error.

## Adding elements at the end

To add another item to the array, we need to use `push_back` like this:

```cpp title="🔹 Adding an item to the array"
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

int main()
{
	using std::vector, std::string, std::cout;

	vector< string > playerNames(3);

	// Setting names of the players
	playerNames[0] = "HappyBanana";
	playerNames[1] = "AngryCrab";
	playerNames[2] = "SadWolf";

	// Adding a new player:
	// highlight-next-line
	playerNames.push_back("WickedWitch");

	// Printing the name of player with index 3
	cout << "Name of the player with index 3: " << playerNames[3];
}
```

```console title="Output"
Name of the player with index 3: WickedWitch
```

From the moment `.push_back(...)` instruction was executed, the `playerNames` array already has four elements.
We say that we *called* the `push_back(...)` *method*. We'll talk more about calls and methods in the future.
For now, just remember that:

1. we put a dot after the name of the array
2. we write the name of the *method*, which is in this case `push_back`
3. then in parentheses we enter what we want to add (e.g. a value or a variable)

Note that after we added the new element, the array has four elements, with indices `0`, `1`, `2` and `3`:

<Columns columns={["auto", "1fr"]}>
<div>

Before:

| Index  | Name |
| ------ | ---- |
| 0      | HappyBanana |
| 1      | AngryCrab   |
| 2      | SadWolf     |

</div>
<div>

After:

| Index  | Name |
| ------ | ---- |
| 0      | HappyBanana     |
| 1      | AngryCrab       |
| 2      | SadWolf         |
| **3**  | **WickedWitch** |

</div>
</Columns>

## Inserting elements at a specific position

At this point you will have to trust me a little. I won't go into details because it's too complicated for now.
To insert **before** index `n` to a vector (in this case `playerNames`) we use the following notation:

```cpp title="Inserting an item to the array"
playerNames.insert(playerNames.begin() + n, elementToInsert);
```

Simply put, `insert` adds an element just before a
specified <Tooltip title={<>An <i>iterator</i> to be precise, but that's for later</>}><b>position</b></Tooltip>
which isn't the same thing as an index. To obtain it, we need to use `begin()` and **add** the index to it.

Knowing this, we will now insert a new player just before the `AngryCrab` (index `1`):

```cpp title="Inserting an item to the array"
playerNames.insert(playerNames.begin() + 1, "BadPenguin");
```

<FullCode content={<FullCode_InsertingElement />} />

This is how the array changes after the insertion:

<Columns columns={["auto", "1fr"]}>
<div>

Before:

| Index  | Name |
| ------ | ---- |
| 0      | HappyBanana |
| 1      | AngryCrab   |
| 2      | SadWolf     |
| 3      | WickedWitch |

</div>
<div>

After:

| Index  | Name |
| ------ | ---- |
| 0      | HappyBanana     |
| **1**  | **BadPenguin**  |
| 2      | AngryCrab       |
| 3      | SadWolf         |
| 4      | WickedWitch     |

</div>
</Columns>

## Removing elements

This is a similar case to inserting elements. We need to specify a **position** again.
So to remove the `n`-th element from a vector (e.g. from `playerNames`) we will use the following notation:

```cpp title="Erasing n-th element from playerNames"
playerNames.erase( playerNames.begin() + n );
```

We'll now remove the first player from the array:

```cpp title="Erasing the first element from playerNames"
playerNames.erase( playerNames.begin() + 0 );
```

<FullCode content={<FullCode_ErasingElement />} />

Note that in this case `+ 0` actually does nothing, but I put it there to make it clear: `playerNames.begin()`
is the same as `playerNames.begin() + 0`.

The contents of the array before and after the removal:

<Columns columns={["auto", "1fr"]}>
<div>

Before:

| Index  | Name |
| ------ | ---- |
| **0**  | **HappyBanana** &lt;-- gets deleted |
| 1      | BadPenguin  |
| 1      | AngryCrab   |
| 2      | SadWolf     |
| 3      | WickedWitch |

</div>
<div>

After:

| Index  | Name |
| ------ | ---- |
| 0      | BadPenguin      |
| 1      | AngryCrab       |
| 2      | SadWolf         |
| 3      | WickedWitch     |

</div>
</Columns>

<br/>

As you can see the first element was removed and the rest of the elements **shifted by one** index.
This is because the array is a **contiguous** block of memory and `vector` ensures that there is no
empty space left after an element is removed.


:::danger
Before erasing an item from an array, make sure it exists (that is, it's in scope `[0, N)`).

```cpp title="🔹 Deleting n-th element from an array (safe)"
int index;
cin >> index; // don't forget to add using std::cin;

if (index >= 0 && index < playerNames.size())
{
	playerNames.erase( playerNames.begin() + index );
}
else
	cout << "Index " << index << " does not exist!";
```

:::

## Reading the size

Because `vector` can change size whenever you want it to, you may sometimes need to read the number of elements
it currently contains. The current size can be read using the `size()` method:

```cpp
// Setting names of the players
playerNames[0] = "HappyBanana";
playerNames[1] = "AngryCrab";
playerNames[2] = "SadWolf";

// highlight-next-line
cout << "The array contains " << playerNames.size() << " elements\n";

// Adding a new player:
playerNames.push_back("WickedWitch");
cout << "Added new player.\n";
// highlight-next-line
cout << "The array contains " << playerNames.size() << " elements\n";
```

```console title="Output"
The array contains 3 elements
Added new player.
The array contains 4 elements
```

<FullCode content={<FullCode_ReadingSize/>}/>

Just like we previously did with the method `push_back`, we write the name after the dot.
Then we put the parentheses, and in the case of `.size` we leave them empty.

## Displaying elements

If we want to display **all** the elements of an array, we'll have to use a *loop*.
We will tell more about loops in the future. They allow you to execute the same
piece of code multiple times.

```cpp title="🔹 Displaying items"
for (string name : playerNames)
{
	cout << "Player name: " << name << '\n';
}
```

```console title="Output"
Player name: HappyBanana
Player name: AngryCrab
Player name: SadWolf
Player name: WickedWitch
```

<FullCode content={<FullCode_DisplayingArrayOfPlayerNames/>}/>

To understand this, let me show you how to "read" it:

> **For** <small>(`for`)</small> **each player name** <small>(`name`)</small>
> **which is of a type** `std::string` **in an array** `playerNames` **execute**
> **the following block of code**...

There is only one statement inside this block of code:

```cpp
cout << "Player name: " << name << '\n';
```

The loop will write the nicknames of the players one by one
into the variable `name`, and execute the display instruction (`cout`) for each of them.

## Summary

We learned how to do basic operations on `std::vector` type. Make sure to check out the sublessons because there is still
a lot to practice. You can find them in the sidebar if you expand the "Dynamic arrays" item.
