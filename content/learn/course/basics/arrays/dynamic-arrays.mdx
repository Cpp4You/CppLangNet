# Dynamic arrays

In this lesson we'll learn how to use dynamic arrays in C++ using [`std::vector`](/docs/std/containers/arrays/vector/).

<details>
<summary>More about vector</summary>
<div>

You might be wondering why the type that represents a dynamic array data structure in C++ uses the name "vector."
It can be confusing for those who associate the term with the mathematical concept of vectors.
Interestingly, this name was chosen by the original author of the STL (Standard Template Library), Alexander Stepanov. However, in retrospect,
[Stepanov admitted](https://stackoverflow.com/a/758548/4386320) that using "vector" as the name of the data structure was a mistake.

`vector` is one of the many [*containers*](/docs/std/containers/) in the standard library. You'll learn about other containers
gradually as you progress through the course. In this lesson I will often use the term *array* and *vector* interchangeably.


</div>
</details>

:::tip Documentation
Once you finish this lesson you can look at the [documentation](/docs/std/containers/arrays/vector/) if you want to learn more about `vector`s.
Be aware that the documentation is not a tutorial, but rather a reference and it may be a bit overwhelming at first.
:::

## Creating a vector

Let's go back and consider the code we've shown in the [Motivation](../introduction/#motivation) section of the previous lesson.
There is a great candidate to be turned into an array. The following variables are of the same type (`std::string`)
and differ only in number at the end of their name.

<CustomCodeBlock fullCode={<FullCode_Motivation/>}>

```cpp
std::string playerName1;
std::string playerName2;
std::string playerName3;
```

</CustomCodeBlock>

Instead of creating three separate variables, we can create one array that contains three elements.

To use `std::vector` we first have to include its header file:

```cpp
#include <vector>
```

As we already know from the [Introduction](../introduction), to create a `vector` we have to know the type of the elements
that will be stored inside it. All elements in a vector are of the same type.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string> // do not forget about string
#include <vector>

int main()
{
	// highlight-next-line
	std::vector<std::string> playerNames(3);
	// ...
}
```

The above example shows how to create a vector that stores `std::string`s.

:::tip Convenience
Before we continue, let's put an appropriate [`using` statement](/learn/course/basics/first-program/#prefix-of-the-standard-namespace)
at the beginning of the `main` function block to skip the `std::` prefix:

```cpp
int main() {
	// highlight-next-line
	using std::vector, std::string;

	vector<string> playerNames(3);
}
```

Later we'll use more elements from the standard library, like `std::cout` and `std::cin`.
You can add these to the `using` statement too.
:::

‚Äù
**vector** is a *template*, which means that it can be used with different types.
We tell it which type to use by putting it in angle brackets right after `vector`. Like this:

```cpp title="üîπ Using vector with different types"
vector< int > arrayOfInts;
vector< float > arrayOfFloats;
vector< char > arrayOfChars;
vector< string > arrayOfStrings;
vector< /*other type*/ > arrayOfXYZ;
```

This code defines the vector `playerNames` that stores text elements (`std::strings`):

```cpp title="Defining a variable of vector type"
vector<string> playerNames(3);
```

Writing (3) after playerNames makes it so that when it is created it will have room for three elements
of type `string` right from the beginning.

```cpp title="Storing 3 elements in the vector"
playerNames(3)
```

Note that this is a vector-specific thing and not a general rule. If you want to create a vector that is initially empty,
just don't write the parentheses at all:

```cpp title="Creating an empty vector"
vector<string> playerNames;
```

:::danger Empty parentheses problem
A mistake that is often made by beginners is to write empty parentheses when creating a vector (or actually any other type):

```cpp title="This is not defining a variable"
vector< string > playerNames();
```

Later in the course you'll learn about **functions**, and the syntax that declares them:

```cpp title="This is actually a function declaration"
// prism-push-types:AnyType
AnyType functionName();
```

This is why the empty parentheses turns this into a function declaration, which is not what we want.

:::


## Accessing elements

There are two ways of accessing an element of a vector, that we're interested in:

- using the [`[]` operator](/docs/std/containers/arrays/vector/operator_subscript/)
- calling the [`at()` method](/docs/std/containers/arrays/vector/at/)

Both ways are very similar, with the only difference being that the `[]` operator does not check if the index is out of bounds.
We'll show you what this means in a moment. Now let's see how we can use them - we'll assign the following names to the players:

| Player index  | Name |
| ------------- | ---- |
| 0             | HappyBanana |
| 1 		    | AngryCrab   |
| 2 		    | SadWolf     |

<br/>

Here is how we can set them in the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

int main()
{
	using std::vector, std::string, std::cout;

	vector<string> playerNames(3);

	// Setting names of the players
	playerNames[0] = "HappyBanana";
	playerNames[1] = "AngryCrab";
	playerNames[2] = "SadWolf";

	// Printing the name of the first player:
	cout << "Name of the first player: " << playerNames[0];
}
```

```console title="Output"
Name of the first player: HappyBanana
```

To access an element of an array, we put its index in square brackets right after the array name:

```cpp
arrayName[ index ]
```

A non-empty array with a number of elements equal to `N` always has indexes  ranging from `0` to `N-1` inclusive.
The three-element array `playerNames` has indexes `0`, `1` and `2`.

### Out of bounds access

A **very common** mistake is to try to access an element with an index that is out of bounds.
If we had tried to rename the player at index `3` the program would most likely crash and burn.

```cpp
// error-next-line
playerNames[3] = "NewPlayer"; // !
```

This code will compile correctly (we might get a warning) but when the program is executed it will try to access
a memory that is not allocated for the program.
This is called a **buffer overflow** and it is a very serious problem.

An alternative, safer way of accessing an element is to use the `at()` method:

```cpp
playerNames.at( 3 ) = "NewPlayer";
```

The difference is that the `at()` method checks if the index is out of bounds and throws an exception if it is.
Be aware that it won't make your program valid by itself. The key benefit is that it will show you a useful
error message and won't allow the program to perform a potentially dangerous operation.

We'll learn more about the syntax we used to call the `at()` method in a moment.

### Example

This is how we can ask a user to enter the name of a certain player:

```cpp
cout << "Enter the name of the second player: ";
// highlight-next-line
cin >> playerNames[1];
```

Now let's output the number of characters in the provided name:

```cpp
cout << "The name of the second player has " << playerNames[1].size() << " characters.\n";
```

```console title="Possible output"
Enter the name of the second player: FuriousFlamingo
The name of the second player has 15 characters.
```

## Providing initial values

There is also a way to provide initial values for the elements of the `vector` right from the beginning:

<CustomCodeBlock fullCode={<FullCode_InitializingVector/>}>

```cpp
vector<string> playerNames = {
	"HappyBanana",
	"AngryCrab",
	"SadWolf",
};
```

</CustomCodeBlock>

<details>
<summary>Alternative syntax</summary>
<div>

In the case of initializing a `vector` you can also omit the `=` sign:

```cpp title="Alternative syntax"
// highlight-next-line
vector<string> playerNames { // note the lack of '='
	"HappyBanana",
	"AngryCrab",
	"SadWolf",
};
```

The result is the same.

</div>
</details>

We will use this method of initialization in the current lesson from now on.

## Adding elements at the end

To add an item to the end of an array (in this case `playerNames`), we need to use `push_back` like this:
<CustomCodeBlock fullCode={<FullCode_AddingElementToArray/>}>

```cpp
// highlight-next-line
playerNames.push_back("WickedWitch");

// Printing the name of player with index 3
cout << "Name of the player with index 3: " << playerNames[3];
```

```console title="Output"
Name of the player with index 3: WickedWitch
```
</CustomCodeBlock>

From the moment `.push_back(...)` instruction was executed, the `playerNames` array already has four elements.
We say that we are *calling* the `push_back(...)` *method*. We'll talk more about calls and methods in the future.
For now, just remember that:

1. we put a dot after the name of the array
2. we write the name of the *method*, which is in this case `push_back`
3. then in parentheses we enter what we want to add (e.g. a value or a variable)

Note that after we added the new element, the array has four elements, with indices `0`, `1`, `2` and `3`:

<Columns columns={["auto", "1fr"]}>
<div>

Before:

| Index  | Name |
| ------ | ---- |
| 0      | HappyBanana |
| 1      | AngryCrab   |
| 2      | SadWolf     |

</div>
<div>

After:

| Index  | Name |
| ------ | ---- |
| 0      | HappyBanana     |
| 1      | AngryCrab       |
| 2      | SadWolf         |
| **3**  | **WickedWitch** |

</div>
</Columns>

<br/>

To let the user add a new player, we can ask them to enter their name, and then add it to the array:

```cpp
std::cout << "Enter the name of the new player: ";
std::string newPlayerName;
// highlight-start
std::cin >> newPlayerName;
playerNames.push_back(newPlayerName);
// highlight-end
```

## Inserting elements at a specific position

At this point you will have to trust me a little. I won't go into details because it's too complicated for now.
To insert **before** index `n` to a vector (in this case `playerNames`) we use the following notation:

```cpp
playerNames.insert(playerNames.begin() + n, elementToInsert);
```

Simply put, `insert` adds an element just before a
specified <Tooltip title={<>An <i>iterator</i> to be precise, but that's for later</>}><b>position</b></Tooltip>
which isn't the same thing as an index. To obtain it, we need to use `begin()` and **add** the index to it.

Knowing this, we will now insert a new player just before the `AngryCrab` (index `1`):

<CustomCodeBlock fullCode={<FullCode_InsertingElement />}>

```cpp
playerNames.insert(playerNames.begin() + 1, "BadPenguin");
```

</CustomCodeBlock>

This is how the array changes after the insertion:

<Columns columns={["auto", "1fr"]}>
<div>

Before:

| Index  | Name |
| ------ | ---- |
| 0      | HappyBanana |
| 1      | AngryCrab   |
| 2      | SadWolf     |
| 3      | WickedWitch |

</div>
<div>

After:

| Index  | Name |
| ------ | ---- |
| 0      | HappyBanana     |
| **1**  | **BadPenguin**  |
| 2      | AngryCrab       |
| 3      | SadWolf         |
| 4      | WickedWitch     |

</div>
</Columns>

## Removing elements

This is a similar case to inserting elements. We need to specify a **position** again.
So to remove the `n`-th element from a vector (e.g. from `playerNames`) we will use the following notation:

```cpp title="Erasing n-th element from playerNames"
playerNames.erase( playerNames.begin() + n );
```

We'll now erase the first player from the array:

<CustomCodeBlock fullCode={<FullCode_ErasingElement />}>

```cpp
playerNames.erase( playerNames.begin() + 0 );
```

</CustomCodeBlock>

Note that in this case `+ 0` actually does nothing, but I put it there to make it clear: `playerNames.begin()`
is the same as `playerNames.begin() + 0`.

The contents of the array before and after the removal:

<Columns columns={["auto", "1fr"]}>
<div>

Before:

| Index  | Name |
| ------ | ---- |
| **0**  | **HappyBanana** &lt;-- gets deleted |
| 1      | BadPenguin  |
| 1      | AngryCrab   |
| 2      | SadWolf     |
| 3      | WickedWitch |

</div>
<div>

After:

| Index  | Name |
| ------ | ---- |
| 0      | BadPenguin      |
| 1      | AngryCrab       |
| 2      | SadWolf         |
| 3      | WickedWitch     |

</div>
</Columns>

<br/>

As you can see the first element was removed and the rest of the elements **shifted by one** index.
This is because the array is a **contiguous** block of memory and `vector` ensures that there is no
empty space left after an element is removed.


:::danger
Before erasing an item from an array, make sure it exists (that is, it's in scope `[0, N)`).

```cpp title="üîπ Deleting n-th element from an array (safe)"
int index;
cin >> index; // don't forget to add using std::cin;

if (index >= 0 && index < playerNames.size())
{
	playerNames.erase( playerNames.begin() + index );
}
else
	cout << "Index " << index << " does not exist!";
```

:::

## Clearing the contents

To clear the contents of a vector, we can use the [`clear()`](/docs/std/containers/arrays/vector/clear/) method:

```cpp
playerNames.clear();
```

After the call, the array will be empty.

## Reading the size

Because `vector` can change size whenever you want it to, you may sometimes need to read the number of elements
it currently contains. The current size can be read using the `size()` method:

<CustomCodeBlock fullCode={<FullCode_ReadingSize/>}>

```cpp
vector<string> playerNames = {
	"HappyBanana",
	"AngryCrab",
	"SadWolf",
};

// highlight-next-line
cout << "The array contains " << playerNames.size() << " elements\n";

// Adding a new player:
playerNames.push_back("WickedWitch");
cout << "Added new player.\n";
// highlight-next-line
cout << "The array contains " << playerNames.size() << " elements\n";
```

</CustomCodeBlock>

```console title="Output"
The array contains 3 elements
Added new player.
The array contains 4 elements
```

Just like we previously did with the method `push_back`, we write the name after the dot.
Then we put the parentheses, and in the case of `.size` we leave them empty.

## Checking if vector is empty

To check if a vector is empty, we can use the `empty()` method like this:

```cpp
if (playerNames.empty())
	cout << "The array is empty!\n";
else
	cout << "The array is not empty!\n";
}
```


## Displaying elements

If we want to display **all** the elements of an array, we'll have to use a *loop*.
We will tell more about loops in the future. They allow you to execute the same
piece of code multiple times.

<CustomCodeBlock fullCode={<FullCode_DisplayingArrayOfPlayerNames/>}>

```cpp title="üîπ Displaying items"
for (string name : playerNames)
{
	cout << "Player name: " << name << '\n';
}
```

</CustomCodeBlock>

```console title="Output"
Player name: HappyBanana
Player name: AngryCrab
Player name: SadWolf
Player name: WickedWitch
```

To understand this, let me show you how to "read" it:

> **For** <small>(`for`)</small> **each player name** <small>(`name`)</small>
> **which is of a type** `std::string` **in an array** `playerNames` **execute**
> **the following block of code**...

There is only one statement inside this block of code:

```cpp
cout << "Player name: " << name << '\n';
```

The loop will write the nicknames of the players one by one
into the variable `name`, and execute the display instruction (`cout`) for each of them.

## Summary

We learned how to do basic operations on `std::vector` type. Make sure to check out the sublessons because there is still
a lot to practice. You can find them in the sidebar if you expand the "Dynamic arrays" item.
