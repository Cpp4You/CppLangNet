# Introduction

As we gradually do calculations on more and more data, regular variables start to be insufficient.
We will use arrays as a comfortable way to store bigger number of variables of the same type.
This lesson will teach you how to create and manipulate arrays in C++.

We will first cover the easiest way, that is
using the [`std::vector`](/docs/std/containers/arrays/vector/) type.

## Motivation

Let's assume that we want to store the nicknames of players who are on the server.
Each name is essentially a text, so we will store it inside a variable
of type [`std::string`](/docs/std/containers/strings/string/).

<!-- IDK why it doesn't work without wrapping with the <></> empty tags. -->

<><Code_Motivation/></>

This code is only capable of handling exactly three players. In a situation where we have 5 players wanting to play,
we will have to use "copy -> paste" a couple additional times. Repeating this is a bad idea.
Instead, we will introduce an array.

## What is an array?

An array is a container that can store *some* number of elements of a certain type.
Look at the picture above. Inside the array we put names of vehicle brands.
Note that each element has its own unique **index**.

:::important Array indices
Elements of an array are indexed from zero upwards.
The first element has an index `0`, the second is at `1`, third at `2` and so on.

Indices are necessary to distinguish array elements.
Using them, we can specify which element we want to access.

## Arrays in C++

There are a few ways to create an array in C++:

Safe ✅:
- a dynamic array using [`std::vector<T>`](/docs/std/containers/arrays/vector/)
- a fixed-size array using [`std::array<T, Num>`](/docs/std/containers/arrays/array/)

Unsafe ❌:
- a dynamic C-style array (e.g `int* array = new int[5]`)
- a fixed-size C-style array (e.g `int array[5]`)

We will focus on the first option, because it is safe and easy to use.
Then we will talk about the last two, which are not recommended to use, and instead we'll provide alternative solutions.

You'll find a full lesson about `std::array` later in the course, because its main advantage is a tiny performance improvement
over `vector` which is not important for the moment.

<summary>Were you told to use C-style arrays?</summary>
<div>

C-style arrays are unfortunately still often taught in schools and universities. There are a few reasons for that, which
we won't discuss here. C++ is a language that is constantly evolving, and the C-style arrays were replaced
by the safer alternatives mentioned above.

With that said, I should mention that a C-style array is not a bad thing in general. A programmer that is fully aware of
problems that can occur when using them, and is able to avoid them, can use them safely. However, this is not the case
for beginners. There are **a lot** of problems you can encounter when using them, and it is very easy to make a mistake.
Keep in mind that `std::vector` and `std::array` cover 100% of use cases of C-style arrays, meaning that
there is no situation where not using C-style array would stand in your way.

### Dynamic vs fixed-size arrays

A **dynamic array** can grow and shrink as needed. In C++ we use [`std::vector`](/docs/std/containers/arrays/vector/) for this purpose.

A **fixed-size array** on the other hand has a constant number of elements, which has to be known at compile time.
This means that we cannot read the number of elements needed from a user and then create the array of exactly that size.
We have to specify it directly in the code. The [`std::array`](/docs/std/containers/arrays/array/) is used for this purpose.

Because of the limitation of the fixed-size array we mentioned above, we'll now focus on the dynamic array because it is easier to use.

### Common operations

There are a lot of things you can do with an array. We'll now go through the most common operations that will cover most of your needs:

1. creating an array
2. accessing elements
3. adding elements
4. reading the number of elements
5. removing elements
6. displaying its contents

Later in the course you'll learn how to run built-in algorithms such as sorting, searching, transforming and so on.
