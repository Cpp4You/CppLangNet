# Dynamic arrays » More examples

Now that we know how to create and use dynamic arrays, let's see some more examples.

:::note Loops
To take full advantage of what we can do with arrays, you'll need to learn about **loops**. We're going to learn about them
right after arrays. Until then in the following example we'll use only the most basic `for` loop that we've shown you already.

## Example 1:

```cpp title="Manipulating list of student grades"
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

int main()
{
	std::vector<std::string> studentNames(3);
	std::vector<int> studentGrades(3);

	// Ask user to enter student names and grades
	std::cout << "Enter the first student's name: ";
	std::cin >> studentNames[0];
	std::cout << "Enter the first student's grade: ";
	std::cin >> studentGrades[0];

	std::cout << "Enter the second student's name: ";
	std::cin >> studentNames[1];
	std::cout << "Enter the second student's grade: ";
	std::cin >> studentGrades[1];

	std::cout << "Enter the third student's name: ";
	std::cin >> studentNames[2];
	std::cout << "Enter the third student's grade: ";
	std::cin >> studentGrades[2];

	// Print out the list of students and their grades
	std::cout << "Student list:" << std::endl;

}
```
