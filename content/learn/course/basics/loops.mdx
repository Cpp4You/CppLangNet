# Loops

In this lesson, we'll make the program execute a given code multiple times, that is, we'll use a loop.

## Motivation

Loops have many uses, here are a few of them:

- ðŸ‘¾ adding, for example, 10 new opponents to the level in the game
- ðŸ–¥ displaying each element in an array
- âž— multiple calculations (e.g. counting factorials, fibonacci sequence)

In the lesson about vectors, we already showed one loop that displayed
all the elements of an array:

```cpp title="ðŸ”¹ Print each number from an array"
for (int n : numbers)
{
	std::cout << n << ' ';
}
```

This is the simplest version of a loop in C++.
You will learn more about their types in the following sections.

## Explanation

In C++, we have the following loops:

- **`for`**
	- range-based version
	- basic version
- **`while`**
- **`do ... while`**

The most common used are `for` and `while`, and we'll cover them in this lesson.
If you want to read about the `do ... while` loop, see the article:
[**`do ... while` loop**](articles/do-while).

:::important Iteration (definition)

### Range-based `for`

This type of loop is most commonly used for working with arrays,
although it can also be used in other ways.

		desc="Scheme"
	/>
<br/>

In the example shown in the [**Motivation**](#motivation) section, there is a **range-based for** loop,
which is a version of the `for` loop for the so-called ranges.
An array as understood in C++ is also a range, so feel free to use it.

The simplest example:

```cpp title="ðŸ”¹ Print each number from an array"
std::vector<int> numbers = { 13, 42, -1, 0, -3, -5 };

for (int n : numbers)
{
	std::cout << n << ' ';
}
```

This loop sequentially traverses each element of the array `numbers` and writes it to the
variable `n`. The block of code enclosed in the curly braces is then executed.
In this case it is a simple printing of the number.

:::caution Colon
Note that the variable name `n` is followed by **a colon (`:`), not a semicolon (`;`)**!
We do not use any equal sign (`=`) in this notation, because the value of each element in turn
will be automatically assigned to `n`.
:::

### `while` loop

<Image center border maxheight="300px"
		src="/img/tutorials/course/basic/loops/while-en.png"
		alt="'while' loop scheme"
		desc="Scheme"
	/>
<br/>

We are now intentionally moving into the `while` loop, rather than the basic `for`, as this will make
the explanation easier. The while loop executes its body as long as the condition is met:

<Columns columns={['2fr', '1fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="ðŸ”¹ Print numbers from 0 to 3"
int number = 0;
while (number <= 3)
{
	std::cout << number << ' ';
	number++;
}
```

</div>
<div>

```plaintext title="Result"
0 1 2 3
```

</div>
</Columns>

The condition will be checked **before** each loop execution and as long as it is satisfied,
i.e. as long as `number` is less than or equal to `3` in this case, the body will be executed.

- printing the `number`
- increasing `number` by 1

After the last loop execution, the value of `number` will be equal to `4`, so the condition will not be
satisfied, causing the loop to terminate and the computer to proceed with the next instructions.

### `for` loop

<Image center border maxheight="300px"
		src="/img/tutorials/course/basic/loops/for-en.png"
		alt=" Schema of a 'for' loop"
		desc="Schema"
	/>
<br/>

This loop is a simplification of a certain **very** frequently repeated pattern, and it is
typically used to step through some range (such as numeric range).

Let's start with an example:

```cpp title="ðŸ”¹ Display numbers from 0 to 9"
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
	std::cout << i << ' ';
}
```

The above loop displays the numbers from 0 to 9. The round bracket at `for` consists of three parts,
separated by ** semicolons**:

| Fragment | Description |
| -------- | ---- |
| `int i = 0` | initial instruction (usually the creation of a variable) |
| `i < 10` | condition |
| `i++` | iteration expression |

When a program starts executing a `for` loop, it executes the initial statement once - in our case
creates a variable and gives it the value `0`.
The program then:

1. checks the condition
	- unfulfilled: leave the loop
	- fulfilled: go to the point 2
2. executes the loop body
3. performs an iteration expression and goes to pt. 1

The above `for` loop is equivalent to:

```cpp
int i = 0;
while (i < 10)
{
	std::cout << i << ' ';
	i++;
}
```

#### Iterating through arrays

The `for` loop is very often used to iterate through arrays, in situations where
we either need access to the iteration number or we do not want to iterate
over the entire range.

```cpp title="ðŸ”¹ Iterating over an entire array"
std::vector<int> numbers = {10, 13, 15, 18, 60};
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++)
{
	std::cout << "numbers[" << i << "]: " << numbers[i] << '}
}
```

```cpp title="ðŸ”¹ Iterating over half of an array"
std::vector<int> numbers = {10, 13, 15, 18, 60};
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size() / 2; i++)
{
	std::cout << "numbers[" << i << "]: " << numbers[i] << '}
}
```

#### Empty parenthesis

The code given in the `for` loop parentheses is optional. **The semicolons are required**.

```cpp title="ðŸ”¹ For loop with empty parentheses"
for ( ; ; )
{
	// code
}
```

The above will make the `for` loop execute infinitely (due to the empty condition),
unless we manually break it...

### Breaking a loop (`break`)

We can stop the loop at any point using the `break` statement:

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
	if (i == 5)
	// highlight-next-line
		break;
	std::cout << i << ' ';
}
```

This loop will display numbers from 0 to 4, because at `i` equal to `5` the execution of the loop will be aborted.
We can break the `while` loop in the same way.

### Skipping a single iteration (`continue`)

To skip further execution of the current loop iteration we use the `continue` statement:

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
	if (i == 5)
	// highlight-next-line
		continue;
	std::cout << i << ' ';
}
```

The loop will display the numbers from `0` to `9`, excluding the number `5`, because before it executes the
display instruction (`std::cout`) the program will jump to the next iteration.

:::caution For loop and continue
Note that using `continue` in a `for` loop does not omit the *iteration expression* ([see diagram above](#for-loop)).
