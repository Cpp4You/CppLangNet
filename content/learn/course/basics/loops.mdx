# Loops

In this lesson, we'll make the program execute a certain code multiple times, that is, we'll use a loop.

## Motivation

Loops are essential in programming because they allow us to repeat a set of instructions multiple times.
They are useful in various scenarios, including:

- üñ• **Array Operations**: Often, we need to perform actions on each element of an array individually.
  Using loops, we can effortlessly display or manipulate every element in the array.
- ‚ûó **Mathematical Computations**: Loops come in handy when performing repeated calculations, such as
  counting factorials or generating a Fibonacci sequence. They enable us to execute the necessary
  operations multiple times, simplifying complex mathematical tasks.
- üëæ **Game Development**: Imagine adding 10 new opponents to a level in a game. With loops, we can
  easily repeat the code that creates the opponents without having to write it 10 times.

In summary, loops provide us with a way to automate repetitive tasks and efficiently process large
sets of data. They significantly improve the flexibility and power of our programs by reducing code duplication.

In the previous lesson on vectors, we already demonstrated one loop that displayed all the elements of an array:

<CustomCodeBlock fullCode={<FullCode_PrintNumbersRangeBasedFor />}>

```cpp showLineNumbers title="Print each number from an array"
for (int n : numbers)
{
  std::cout << n << ' ';
}
```

</CustomCodeBlock>

This is the simplest version of a loop in C++, but there are other types of loops that we'll cover in this lesson.

## Explanation

In C++, there are three types of loops:

- **`for`**
	- range-based version
	- basic version
- **`while`**
- **`do ... while`**

The most common used are `for` and `while`, and we'll cover them in this lesson.
If you want to read about the `do ... while` loop, see the article:
[**`do ... while` loop**](articles/do-while).

:::important Iteration (definition)
**Iteration** - a single loop body execution.
:::

### Range-based `for`

This type of loop is most commonly used for working with arrays,
although it can also be used in other ways.

<Image center border maxheight="300px"
		src="/img/tutorials/course/basic/loops/range-based-for-en.png"
		alt="range-based 'for' loop scheme"
		desc="Scheme"
	/>
<br/>

In the example provided in the [**Motivation**](#motivation) section, we have a special type of loop called the **range-based for** loop.
It's a variation of the regular `for` loop used for working with collections of items. It is worth mentioning that
an array in C++ is also a range, so we can use this loop to iterate over it.

Take a look at the example:

<CustomCodeBlock fullCode={<FullCode_PrintNumbersRangeBasedFor />}>

```cpp showLineNumbers title="Print each number from an array"
std::vector<int> numbers = { 13, 42, -1, 0, -3, -5 };

for (int n : numbers)
{
	std::cout << n << ' ';
}
```

</CustomCodeBlock>

This loop sequentially traverses each element of the array `numbers` and writes it to the
variable `n`. The block of code enclosed in the curly braces is then executed.
In this case it is a simple printing of the number.

:::caution Colon
Note that the variable name `n` is followed by **a colon (`:`), not a semicolon (`;`)**!
We do not use any equal sign (`=`) in this notation, because the value of each element in turn
will be automatically assigned to `n`.
:::

#### Altering the content

It is possible to modify each element of the array in the loop body. Let's write a program that
will increase each even number in the array by 100 and decrease each odd number by 100.
use the reference to the element. Before we explain exactly what it is and how it works, let's
look at the following example:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="with_ref" label="‚úÖ Modify an original number">

```cpp showLineNumbers
std::vector<int> numbers = { 13, 42, -1, 0, -3, -5 };

// highlight-next-line
for (int& n : numbers)
{
  if (n % 2 == 0) {
    n += 100;
  }
  else {
    n -= 100;
  }
}

// warning-next-line
// numbers: { -87, 142, -101, 100, -103, -105 }
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="without_ref" label="‚ùå Modify a copy">

```cpp showLineNumbers
std::vector<int> numbers = { 13, 42, -1, 0, -3, -5 };

// warning-next-line
for (int n : numbers)
{
  if (n % 2 == 0) {
    n += 100;
  }
  else {
    n -= 100;
  }
}

// warning-next-line
// numbers: { 13, 42, -1, 0, -3, -5 }
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

In the first case, we used a **reference** type, which is denoted by the ampersand (`&`) right after the
type name. For now the key thing to know is:

- using a reference type (e.g. `for (int& n : numbers)`)  
  In this case, the variable `n` uses a **reference type** allowing you to modify the original element of the array.
  This is because with each iteration of the loop, the variable `n` becomes an *alias* of the currently processed element.
- using a non-reference (e.g. `for (int n : numbers)`)  
  On the other hand, if we don't use a reference type, with each iteration of the loop, a **copy** of the currently processed element
  is created and assigned to the variable `n`. This means that the original element of the array cannot be modified.

This applies to any type, not only an `int`. This means that it is equally possible to modify the elements of an array of strings,
real numbers (e.g. `float`) and custom types that we will cover in the next lessons.

We'll talk more about references in one of the next lessons: [References](../references).

#### With an initializer list

This loop can also be used with the so-called *initializer list*

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="numbers" label="Numbers">

```cpp showLineNumbers title="Print each number from an initializer list"
for (int number : { 2, 1, 3, 7 })
{
  std::cout << number << ' ';
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="strings" label="Strings">

```cpp showLineNumbers title="Print each number from an initializer list"
for (std::string str : { "hello", "world", "using", "initializer", "list" })
{
  std::cout << str << ' ';
}
````

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Note that you cannot use the range-based `for` loop to modify the elements of an initializer list,
so the following code will produce an error:

```cpp title="‚ùå Cannot modify elements of an initializer list"
// error-next-line
for (int& a_number_from_list : { 2, 1, 3, 7 })
```

#### There's more

Range-based for loops are simple and easy to use, but at the same time are very flexible.
We only scratched the surface of what you can do with them. We'll cover them in more detail later
in the course.

### `while` loop

<Image center border maxheight="300px"
		src="/img/tutorials/course/basic/loops/while-en.png"
		alt="'while' loop scheme"
		desc="Scheme"
	/>
<br/>

We are now intentionally moving into the `while` loop, rather than the basic `for`, as this will make
the explanation easier. The while loop executes its body as long as the condition is met:

<Columns columns={['2fr', '1fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="Print numbers from 0 to 3"
int number = 0;
while (number <= 3)
{
	std::cout << number << ' ';
	number++;
}
```

</div>
<div>

```plaintext title="Result"
0 1 2 3
```

</div>
</Columns>

The condition will be checked **before** each loop execution and as long as it is satisfied,
i.e. as long as `number` is less than or equal to `3` in this case, the body will be executed.

- printing the `number`
- increasing `number` by 1

After the last loop execution, the value of `number` will be equal to `4`, so the condition will not be
satisfied, causing the loop to terminate and the computer to proceed with the next instructions.

### `for` loop

<Image center border maxheight="300px"
		src="/img/tutorials/course/basic/loops/for-en.png"
		alt=" Schema of a 'for' loop"
		desc="Schema"
	/>
<br/>

This loop is a simplification of a certain **very** frequently repeated pattern, and it is
typically used to step through some range (such as numeric range).

Let's start with an example:

```cpp title="Display numbers from 0 to 9"
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
	std::cout << i << ' ';
}
```

The above loop displays the numbers from 0 to 9. The round bracket at `for` consists of three parts,
separated by ** semicolons**:

| Fragment | Description |
| -------- | ---- |
| `int i = 0` | initial instruction (usually the creation of a variable) |
| `i < 10` | condition |
| `i++` | iteration expression |

When a program starts executing a `for` loop, it executes the initial statement once - in our case
creates a variable and gives it the value `0`.
The program then:

1. checks the condition
	- unfulfilled: leave the loop
	- fulfilled: go to the point 2
2. executes the loop body
3. performs an iteration expression and goes to pt. 1

The above `for` loop is equivalent to:

```cpp
int i = 0;
while (i < 10)
{
	std::cout << i << ' ';
	i++;
}
```

#### Iterating through arrays

The `for` loop is very often used to iterate through arrays, in situations where
we either need access to the iteration number or we do not want to iterate
over the entire range.

```cpp title="Iterating over an entire array"
std::vector<int> numbers = {10, 13, 15, 18, 60};
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size(); i++)
{
	std::cout << "numbers[" << i << "]: " << numbers[i] << '}
}
```

```cpp title="Iterating over half of an array"
std::vector<int> numbers = {10, 13, 15, 18, 60};
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.size() / 2; i++)
{
	std::cout << "numbers[" << i << "]: " << numbers[i] << '}
}
```

#### Empty parenthesis

The code given in the `for` loop parentheses is optional. **The semicolons are required**.

```cpp title="For loop with empty parentheses"
for ( ; ; )
{
	// code
}
```

The above will make the `for` loop execute infinitely (due to the empty condition),
unless we manually break it...

### Breaking a loop (`break`)

We can stop the loop at any point using the `break` statement:

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
	if (i == 5)
	// highlight-next-line
		break;
	std::cout << i << ' ';
}
```

This loop will display numbers from 0 to 4, because at `i` equal to `5` the execution of the loop will be aborted.
We can break the `while` loop in the same way.

### Skipping a single iteration (`continue`)

To skip further execution of the current loop iteration we use the `continue` statement:

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
	if (i == 5)
	// highlight-next-line
		continue;
	std::cout << i << ' ';
}
```

The loop will display the numbers from `0` to `9`, excluding the number `5`, because before it executes the
display instruction (`std::cout`) the program will jump to the next iteration.

:::caution For loop and continue
Note that using `continue` in a `for` loop does not omit the *iteration expression* ([see diagram above](#for-loop)).
