# First program

This lesson will teach you how to write your first simple C++ program
that can display text and perform simple calculations.

## Application code

We finished the previous lesson with the following code:

<Columns spacing={40} columns={['7fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="main.cpp"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Hello, World!";
}
```

</div>

<div>

```plaintext title="Result (console)"
Hello, World!
```

</div>
</Columns>

Which displays the text given above in the "Result" box.


## Explaination

### The main function

Let's start with the heart of our application, *the main function*

```cpp title="Part of main.cpp"
int main()
{

}
```

The computer runs the program line by line.
When it starts the application, it executes the instructions in the `main` code block sequentially.

A **code block** in C++, is a set of instructions contained inside curly braces:

```cpp
{

}
```

The function `main` has a block of code, and everything between the curly braces will be executed <u>sequentially, top to bottom</u>.

### The `iostream` library

At the very beginning of the code there is a line:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
```

This allows us to use the standard input and output tools provided by C++. The name `iostream` is short for *input/output stream*.
In practice, this means that we the programmer can write a message in the **console**; then, our program can intercept the response from the user.
We'll tell more about `#include` itself in the future. Enough for the moment.

### The console

The "console" or "terminal" is the most basic form of communication for a program. It allows for a simple, two-way text interface between the program and the user.
You're going to become very familiar with this tool, as you will be using it every step of the way on your journey to becoming an expert programmer.

Below are some examples of consoles after running our Hello World program. While not every terminal is the same, they will look very similar
by only displaying simple text with little to no color.

#### ðŸ–¼ Examples of some consoles:

<Tabs groupId="consoles">
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>
	<Image center
			alt="Example of what a Windows console may look like"
			src="/img/tutorials/course/basic/first-program/example-terminal-windows.png"
		/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
	<Image center
			alt="Example of what a Linux console may look like"
			src="/img/tutorials/course/basic/first-program/example-terminal-linux.png"
		/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Many coding applications like Visual Studio, VSCode, CLion, Vim, etc., have a console window integrated directly into the interface.

TODO: We will provide a tutorial for how to use a terminal and perform common operations.

### Printing text to the console



We used this statement inside a `main` block:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, World!";
```

`cout` is the a **c**haracter **out**put stream, however, for the moment,
remember that it just displays the quoted text to the console.

If I now copy this line several times:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, World!1";
std::cout << "Hello, World!2";
std::cout << "Hello, World!3";
```

then I will get the following effect:

```
Hello, World!1Hello, World!2Hello, World!3
```

:::caution Semicolon at the end of instructions!
A semicolon (`;`) separates instructions. The compiler doesn't care about instructions being written on separate lines.
The semicolon is treated as the end of the statement. For this reason, such a code:
```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, World!1"; std::cout << "Hello, World!2"; std::cout << "Hello, World!3";
```

it is **acceptable** but very illegible. Don't write code like this!
:::

Presentation of the above-created program:

<GoogleSlides
		src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTsdQPMXKN90rcz4i515JK-rpUHjHTc5xIjGVtNJS8XSbloMNObHEBUSszvYi9I7tuKBNIdEKNFh1jk/embed"
		aspectRatio={960 / 500}
		delay={500}
		centered
	/>

Note that the text typed to the console without any spaces,
on a single line, and wrapped only towards the end of the available space.

The program does exactly what it says in the code - no more, no less.
We only "told" it that it should display the given characters... and it does.
We have to "break" the line in the right place. This will cause the following characters
to be displayed from the very beginning of the next line. To do this,
put a special newline character inside the text: `\n`, like this:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, World!\n";
```

:::caution Backslash
Note that **backslash** (`\n`) is used, not slash (`/n`).
:::

Program execution after adding newline characters:

<GoogleSlides
		src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRtT6R8wewyaM8WZRUP-KIREO_1HEdReq-BhpmUYKsVWRm5VbRRn7jZbhZyMIZMVzarQ1xkGrjS2eoM/embed"
		aspectRatio={960 / 500}
		delay={500}
		centered
	/>

:::important Newline Character
`\n` is a **single character**, although to get it we have to write two characters <u>in the code</u>.
This is because inside the text in the code, we can't put an Enter/Return.
Backslash (`\`) tells computer that the character that follows it has a special meaning.
(its called an *escape sequence*, more on that later).
:::

### Prefix of the standard namespace

`std::` is the prefix of the **standard library** from which `cout` comes.

Beginners often find typing `std::` to be unwieldy. It can be omitted if we give the appropriate line of code beforehand:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	// highlight-next-line
	using std::cout;
	cout << "Hello, World!";
}
```

Now, all statements within this code block below the `using` line can omit the `std::` prefix for `cout`.

:::caution using namespace std
In many other online tutorials and sources, it is extremely common to find others recommending `using namespace std;` at the <u>top of your file</u>.
While this is legal C++, it is **strongly discouraged** by nearly all experienced C++ programmers. We will cover these reasons later.

For the time being, prefer the style displayed above.
:::

## Performing calculations

Programming is used to automate certain activities.
For example, we can have a computer do a mathematical calculation for us.

Use the following code:

<Columns spacing={40} columns={['7fr', '5fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="main.cpp"
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	std::cout << "120 * 120 + 540";
}
```

</div>
<div>

```plaintext title="Result (console)"
120 * 120 + 540
```

</div>
</Columns>

Pay attention to the result of the above program.

:::info Text vs Instructions
Everything in quotation marks is treated as text, not instructions.
:::

Therefore, instead of displaying the result of the calculation,
we got what we entered in the quotation marks.

To say that we want to perform some calculation, we need to remove the quotes:

<Columns spacing={40} columns={['7fr', '5fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="main.cpp"
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	std::cout << 120 * 120 + 540;
}
```

</div>
<div>

```plaintext title="Result (console)"
14940
```

</div>
</Columns>

After starting the program, we will get the correct result of the calculation in the code.

:::important Mathematical operators
- `+` adds two numbers together
- `-` subtracts two numbers from each other
- `*` multiplies two numbers by itself
- `/` divides two numbers by itself
- `()` parentheses order operations

The order math in C++ is done follows the "PEMDAS" order you may have learned in school.

1. First Parentheses
2. Then Multiplication/Division from left to right
3. Finally Addition/Subtraction from left to right
:::

## Potential errors

Finally, it is worth paying attention to what can cause a **compilation error**. Compilation errors are caused by invalid C++.
When the compiler encounters invalid code, it will stop and tell you what's wrong. You cannot run your program unless compilation is
completed without errors.

### Omiting `std::`

:::tip Good practice
It's best not to omit the `std::` prefix.
:::

If you have trouble with the `std::` prefix, consider using it
locally, **always inside a function** (as shown in the example):

```cpp title="ðŸ”¹ Acceptable use"
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	// highlight-next-line
	using namespace std;
	cout << "Hello, World!";
}
```

I emphasize this because it is possible to place `using namespace std;` 
at the top of your file, but **don't do this** (even though it's all over the Internet!), as it can lead to mysterious errors stemming from ambiguity.
This is because `std` has a **huge** amount of names that you will commonly use in your code.

#### `using namespace std` vs `using std::cout`
- `using namespace std;` means that you don't need to prepend `std::` for any member of the standard library you use.
Common items you may see on your journey and in later tutorials are `cout`, `cin`, `string`, `array`, and `vector`.

- `using std::cout;` means that only `cout` has the privilege to not require `std::` in front of it. You can do this for multiple items at once like:
`using std::cout, std::cin, std::string;`


Generally, it is recommended to use the `using std::cout;` style over `using namespace std;` if you wish to omit `std::`.

### Missing semicolons `;`

Beginners often forget the semicolons (`;`) at the end of statements.
Study the code examples provided in this lesson carefully, paying attention
to where they should go.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info Flaky Error Messages
Compilers have to guess where you missed a semicolon. Therefore if you are sure that you didn't miss
a semicolon on the line it tells you about, try looking up a few lines.

Additionally missing semicolons can also cause unrelated errors further down your code.
Usually the first error message given by the compiler is the most helpful one.
:::

### Unterminated text

Text is always between the quote characters `"TEXT IS HERE!"`. 
Forgetting to add the second quotation mark leads to C++ thinking the rest of your program is text.

### Using `"`

You may be tempted to put quotes inside a message when outputting it to the console.
However, remember that C++ considers everything inside of `"..."` quotes to be text.

Thus, if you write:
```cpp
"Hi! My name is "Slim Shady". Nice to meet you!"
```

C++ will interpret this as:
```plaintext
"TEXT" C++ CODE "TEXT"
```

You can prevent this by using the `\` backslash character to *escape* the quote.

```cpp
"Hi! My name is \"Slim Shady\". Nice to meet you!"
```

#### ðŸ”´ Error message

<Tabs groupId="compiler">
<TabItem value="gcc" label="GCC" default>

```plaintext
error: unable to find string literal operator â€˜operator""Slimâ€™ with â€˜const char [16]â€™, â€˜long unsigned intâ€™ arguments

:::info Unhelpful errors
These error messages aren't that helpful! Your hint should be the fact that it is treating what you intend to be text as code.
