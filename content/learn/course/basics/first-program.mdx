# First program

This lesson will teach you how to write your first simple C++ program
that can display text and perform simple calculations.

## Application code

We finished the previous lesson with the following code:

<Columns spacing={40} columns={['7fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="main.cpp"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Hello, World!";
}
```

</div>

<div>

```plaintext title="Result (console)"
Hello, World!
```

</div>
</Columns>

It displays the "Hello, World" text in the console.


## Explanation

### The main function

Let's start with the heart of our application, *the main function*

```cpp title="Part of main.cpp"
int main()
{

}
```


The first line starts the **function definition**. It consists of a return type `int`, the name `main`, and its parameters inside the `()` (none in our case).
While most of these terms aren't important now, all that you should pay attention to is the name `main`. It will always look like this,
`int main()`. Your program must always contain the `main` function specified in this format.

The computer runs the program line by line. When it starts the application, it executes the instructions in the `main` code block sequentially.

A **code block** in C++, is a set of instructions contained inside curly braces:

```cpp
{

}
```

The `main` function has a block of code, and everything between its curly braces will be executed <u>top to bottom</u>.

:::important Remember
The content of the `main` function **is always the first code run by the program.**
:::

### The `iostream` header file

At the very beginning of the code there is a line:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
```

This allows us to use the standard input and output tools provided by C++. The name `iostream` is short for *input/output stream*.
In practice, this means that we the programmer can write a message in the **console**; then, our program can intercept the response from the user.
We'll tell more about `#include` itself in the future. Enough for the moment.

### The console

The "console" or "terminal" is the most basic form of communication for a program. It allows for a simple, two-way text interface between the program and the user.
You're going to become very familiar with this tool, as you will be using it every step of the way on your journey to becoming an expert programmer.

Below are some examples of running <Tooltip title="It is an example that calculates the area of a trapezoid. We'll cover similar topic later in the course.">the same code</Tooltip>
in multiple environments. While not every terminal is the same, they will look very similar by only displaying simple text with little to no color.

#### ðŸ–¼ Overview:

</iframe>
</center>

As you can see, many code editors like Visual Studio, VS Code, Replit.com, CLion, Vim, etc., have a console window integrated directly into the interface.

<!--- TODO: We will provide a tutorial for how to use a terminal and perform common operations. --->

### Printing text to the console


To display text to the console we used the following statement inside the `main` block:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, World!";
```

The name `cout` stands for a **c**haracter **out**put. 

I can now duplicate the line above like this:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, World!1";
std::cout << "Hello, World!2";
std::cout << "Hello, World!3";
```

to get the following effect:

```
Hello, World!1Hello, World!2Hello, World!3
```

:::caution Semicolon at the end of instructions!
A semicolon (`;`) separates instructions. The compiler doesn't care about instructions being written on separate lines.
The semicolon is treated as the end of the statement. For this reason, such code as below is *acceptable* but very illegible.
```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, World!1"; std::cout << "Hello, World!2"; std::cout << "Hello, World!3";
```

 Don't write code like this!
:::

Presentation of the above-created program:

<GoogleSlides
		src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTsdQPMXKN90rcz4i515JK-rpUHjHTc5xIjGVtNJS8XSbloMNObHEBUSszvYi9I7tuKBNIdEKNFh1jk/embed"
		aspectRatio={960 / 500}
		delay={500}
		centered
	/>

Note that the text was written to the console without any spaces,
in a single line, and wrapped when it reached the end of the available space.

The program does exactly what it says in the code - no more, no less.
We told it that it should display the given characters... and it does.
We have to explicitly "break" the line in the right place. This will cause the following characters
to be displayed from the very beginning of the next line. To do this,
we put a special newline character inside the text: `\n`, like this:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, World!\n";
```

:::caution Backslash
Note that we used the **backslash** (`\n`), and not the forward slash (`/n`).
:::

Program execution after adding newline characters:

<GoogleSlides

		aspectRatio={960 / 500}
		delay={500}
		centered
	/>

:::important Newline Character
The `\n` sequence represents a **single character**. We have to write two characters <u>in the code</u> but for the program, it is a single special character.
This is because we cannot simply insert an Enter or Return directly inside the text in the code.
Backslash (`\`) is used to sign that the character that follows it <Tooltip title={<>It is called an <b>escape sequence</b>, more on that later</>}>has a special meaning</Tooltip>.

:::

### Prefix of the standard namespace

`std::` is the prefix of the **standard library namespace** from which `cout` comes.

Beginners often find typing `std::` to be unwieldy. It can be omitted if we give the appropriate line of code beforehand:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	// highlight-next-line
	using std::cout;
	cout << "Hello, World!";
}
```

Now, all statements within this code block below the `using` line can omit the `std::` prefix for `cout`.

:::caution using namespace std
In many other online tutorials and sources, it is extremely common to find others recommending `using namespace std;` at the <u>top of your file</u>.
While this is legal C++, it is **strongly discouraged** by nearly all experienced C++ programmers. We will cover these reasons later.

For the time being, prefer the style displayed above.
:::

## Performing calculations

Programming is used to automate certain activities.
For example, we can have a computer do a mathematical calculation for us.

Use the following code:

<Columns spacing={40} columns={['7fr', '5fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="main.cpp"
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	std::cout << "120 * 120 + 540";
}
```

</div>
<div>

```plaintext title="Result (console)"
120 * 120 + 540
```

</div>
</Columns>

Pay attention to the result of the above program.

:::info Text vs Instructions
Everything in quotation marks is treated as text, not instructions.
:::

Therefore, instead of displaying the result of the calculation,
we got what we entered in the quotation marks.

To say that we want to perform some calculation, we need to remove the quotes:

<Columns spacing={40} columns={['7fr', '5fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="main.cpp"
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	std::cout << 120 * 120 + 540;
}
```

</div>
<div>

```plaintext title="Result (console)"
14940
```

</div>
</Columns>

After starting the program, we will get the correct result of the calculation in the code.

:::important Mathematical operators
- `+` adds two numbers together
- `-` subtracts two numbers from each other
- `*` multiplies two numbers by itself
- `/` divides two numbers by itself
- `()` parentheses order operations

C++ adheres to the "PEMDAS" order you may have learned in school.

1. First Parentheses
2. Then Multiplication/Division from left to right
3. Finally Addition/Subtraction from left to right
