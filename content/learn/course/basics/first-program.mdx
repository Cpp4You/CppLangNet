# First program

This lesson will teach you how to write your first simple C++ program
that can display text and perform simple calculations.

## Application code

We finished the previous lesson with the following code:

<Columns spacing={40} columns={['7fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="main.cpp"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Hello, World!";
}
```

</div>

<div>

```plaintext title="Result (console)"
Hello, World!
```

</div>
</Columns>

Which displays the text given above in the "Result" box.


## Explaination

### The main function

Let's start with the heart of our application, *the main function*

```cpp title="Part of main.cpp"
int main()
{

}
```

The computer runs the program line by line.
When it starts the application, it executes the instructions in the `main` code block sequentially.

A **code block** in C++, is a set of instructions contained inside curly braces:

```cpp
{

}
```

The function `main` has a block of code, and everything between the parentheses will be executed sequentially.

### The `iostream` library

At the very beginning of the code there is a line:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
```

It will allow us to continue using the input and output functions (hence `iostream` - from *input/output stream*).
In practice, this means that we will be able to write something in the console and let the user type something into the console and intercept it.
We'll tell more about `#include` itself in the future. Enough for the moment.

### Printing text to the console

We used this statement inside a `main` block:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, World!";
```

`cout` is the a **c**haracter **out**put stream, however, for the moment,
remember that it just displays the quoted text to the console.

If I now copy this line several times:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, World!1";
std::cout << "Hello, World!2";
std::cout << "Hello, World!3";
```

then I will get the following effect:

```
Hello, World!1Hello, World!2Hello, World!3
```

:::caution Semicolon at the end of instructions!
A semicolon (`;`) separates instructions. The compiler doesn't care about instructions being written on separate lines.
The semicolon is treated as the end of the statement. For this reason, such a code:
```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, World!1"; std::cout << "Hello, World!2"; std::cout << "Hello, World!3";
```

it is **acceptable** but very illegible.
:::

Presentation of the above-created program:

<GoogleSlides
		src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTsdQPMXKN90rcz4i515JK-rpUHjHTc5xIjGVtNJS8XSbloMNObHEBUSszvYi9I7tuKBNIdEKNFh1jk/embed"
		aspectRatio={960 / 500}
		delay={500}
		centered
	/>

Note that the text typed to the console without any spaces,
on a single line, and wrapped only towards the end of the available space.

The program does exactly what it says in the code - no more, no less.
We only "told" it that it should display the given characters... and it does.
We have to "break" the line in the right place. This will cause the following characters
to be displayed from the very beginning of the next line. To do this,
put a special newline character inside the text: `\n`, like this:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, World!\n";
```

:::caution Backslash
Note that **backslash** (`\n`) is used, not slash (`/n`)
:::

Program execution after adding newline characters:

<GoogleSlides
		src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRtT6R8wewyaM8WZRUP-KIREO_1HEdReq-BhpmUYKsVWRm5VbRRn7jZbhZyMIZMVzarQ1xkGrjS2eoM/embed"
		aspectRatio={960 / 500}
		delay={500}
		centered
	/>

:::important Uwaga
`\n` is a **single character**, although to get it we have to write two characters <u>in the code</u>.
This is because inside the text in the code, we can't put an Enter/Return.
Backslash (`\`) tells computer that the character that follows it has a special meaning.
(its called an *escape sequence*, more on that later).
:::

### Prefix of the standard namespace

`std::` is the prefix of the **standard library** from which `cout` comes.

It can be omitted if we give the appropriate line of code beforehand:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	// highlight-next-line
	using namespace std;
	cout << "Hello, World!";
}
```

However, many experienced programmers recommend writing `std::`.
More on that later in our course.

## Performing calculations

Programming is used to automate certain activities.
For example, we can have a computer do a mathematical calculation for us.

Use the following code:

<Columns spacing={40} columns={['7fr', '5fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="main.cpp"
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	std::cout << "120 * 120 + 540";
}
```

</div>
<div>

```plaintext title="Result (console)"
120 * 120 + 540
```

</div>
</Columns>

Pay attention to the result of the above program.

:::caution
Everything in quotation marks is treated as text, not instructions.
:::

Therefore, instead of displaying the result of the calculation,
we got what we entered in the quotation marks.

To say that we want to perform some calculation, we need to remove the quotes:

<Columns spacing={40} columns={['7fr', '5fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="main.cpp"
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	std::cout << 120 * 120 + 540;
}
```

</div>
<div>

```plaintext title="Result (console)"
14940
```

</div>
</Columns>

After starting the program, we will get the correct result of the calculation in the code.

:::important Mathematical operators
- `+` adds two numbers together
- `-` subtracts two numbers from each other
- `*` multiplies two numbers by itself
- `/` divides two numbers by itself
:::

## Potential errors

Finally, it is worth paying attention to what can cause a **compilation error**,
or what we shouldn't do to keep the code in line with good practice.

### Omiting `std::`

:::tip Good practice
It's best not to omit the `std::` prefix.
:::

If you have trouble with the `std::` prefix, consider using it
locally, **always inside a function** (as shown in the example):

```cpp title="ðŸ”¹ Acceptable use"
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	// highlight-next-line
	using namespace std;
	cout << "Hello, World!";
}
```

I emphasize this because it is possible to place

```cpp
using namespace std;
```

also before the whole `main` function, however **don't do it**.

### Missing semicolons `;`

Beginners often forget the semicolons (`;`) at the end of statements.
Study the code examples provided in this lesson carefully, paying attention
to where they should go.

the text this quotation mark actually appears.
