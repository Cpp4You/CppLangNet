# First program

This lesson will teach you how to write your first simple C++ program
that can display text and perform simple calculations.

## Application code

We finished the previous lesson with the following code:

<Columns spacing={40} columns={['7fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp showLineNumbers title="main.cpp"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Hello, World!";
}
```

</div>

<div>

```console title="Result (console)"
Hello, World!
```

</div>
</Columns>

It displays the "Hello, World" text in the console.


## Explanation

### The main function

Every C++ program contains a piece of code that we call *the main function*. It is the first[^1]
code that is run on the program startup.

```cpp
int main()
{

}
```

The first line of the above code starts the **function definition**. It consists of a return type `int`, the name `main`, and its parameters
inside the `()` (none in our case). While most of these terms aren't important now, all that you should pay attention to is
the name `main`. Your program must always contain the `main` function specified in this format.

<details>
<summary>There are more variants</summary>
<div>

There are a number of ways to write the `main` function, but for now, we will stick to the simplest one - the one we showed above.
Sometimes you may see the `main` function that starts with either of the following:

```cpp
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
```

```cpp
int main(int argc, char** argv)
```

```cpp
auto main(int argc, char** argv) -> int
```

```cpp
auto main() -> int
```

While there are even more variants possible, they all do the same thing - they define the entry point of the program.
We'll cover the differences between them in the future.

</div>
</details>

[^1]: In reality there is more code executed before the `main` function, that mostly deals with setting up the program
      but this is not important for now.

#### Blocks of code

Itâ€™s important for the program to know where `main` starts and ends. We use code blocks for this.
A **code block** in C++, is a set of instructions contained inside curly braces:

<CustomCodeBlock inspectionSetup={CodeBlockContentInspection}>

```cpp showLineNumbers title="Content of the code block"
outside
int main()
{
  inside
}
outside
```

</CustomCodeBlock>

Everything between the curly braces counts as inside the code block and everything else is outside of it.

#### Order of execution

The `main` function has a block of code that contains instructions provided by the programmer.
The computer runs the instructions in order, or in simpler words - line by line, top to bottom.
When the program is run the first line inside `main` is executed, then the second one and so on.

:::important Remember
The content of the `main` function the first code run by the program.
:::

In the following example, we put three instructions inside the `main` function to illustrate the order of execution.
You'll learn more about the `std::cout` later in this lesson.

<CustomCodeBlock inspectionSetup={InstructionOrderInspection}>

```cpp showLineNumbers title="Preview of the execution order"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  std::cout << "This is an instruction that displays text.";
  std::cout << "And this is another instruction that displays text.";
  std::cout << "This is the third instruction that displays text.";
}
```

</CustomCodeBlock>

### The `iostream` header file

<Image center

		alt="Illustration on header file inclusion"
		src="/img/tutorials/course/basic/first-program/include-iostream-en.webp"
		desc="What does the #include directive actually do :)"
	/>
<br/>

At the very beginning of the code there is a line:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
```

This allows us to use the standard input and output tools provided by C++. The name `iostream` is short for *input/output stream*.
In practice this will let the us output text that the user can see and take input text to change what the program does.

The name `iostream` refers to a **header file** on your disk that comes with the *C++ standard library*.
We will explain more about them and `#include` in near future. For now, remember that in most cases we put
`#include <header_file>` at the beginning of the file.

### The console

The "console" or "terminal" is the most basic form of communication for a program. It allows for a simple, two-way text interface between the program and the user.
You're going to become very familiar with this tool, as you will be using it every step of the way on your journey to becoming an expert programmer.

Below are some examples of running <Tooltip title="It is an example that calculates the area of a trapezoid. We'll cover similar topic later in the course.">the same code</Tooltip>
in multiple environments. While not every terminal is the same, they will look very similar by only displaying simple text with little to no color.

#### ðŸ–¼ Overview:

	frameBorder="0"
	allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
	allowFullScreen>
</iframe>
</center>

As you can see many code editors like Visual Studio, VS Code, Replit.com, CLion, Vim, etc., have a console built-in into them.

<!--- TODO: We will provide a tutorial for how to use a terminal and perform common operations. --->

### Printing text to the console

To display text in the console we used the following statement inside the `main` block:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, World!";
```

The name `cout` stands for a **c**haracter **out**put. It is used to send text to the console.
We will mention the `std::` prefix in a minute.

<details>
<summary>For those who are curious</summary>
<div>

Strictly speaking, `cout` is a so-called character output stream that writes the content to a *standard output*, which in this case is your console,
but you don't need to remember that for the moment.

</div>
</details>


If we copy this line a couple of times

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, World!1";
std::cout << "Hello, World!2";
std::cout << "Hello, World!3";
```

our output changes to this:

```
Hello, World!1Hello, World!2Hello, World!3
```

:::caution Semicolon at the end of instructions!
A semicolon (`;`) separates instructions. The compiler doesn't care about instructions being written on separate lines.
The semicolon is treated as the end of the statement. For this reason, such code as below is *acceptable* but very illegible.
```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, World!1"; std::cout << "Hello, World!2"; std::cout << "Hello, World!3";
```

Do not write code like this!
:::

Presentation of the above-created program:

<GoogleSlides
		src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTsdQPMXKN90rcz4i515JK-rpUHjHTc5xIjGVtNJS8XSbloMNObHEBUSszvYi9I7tuKBNIdEKNFh1jk/embed"
		aspectRatio={960 / 500}
		delay={500}
		centered
	/>

Note that the text was written to the console without any spaces,
in a single line, and wrapped when it reached the end of the available space.

The program does exactly what it says in the code - no more, no less.
We told it that it should display the given characters... and it does.
We have to explicitly "break" the line in the right place. This will cause the following characters
to be displayed from the very beginning of the next line. To do this,
we put a special newline character inside the text: `\n`, like this:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, World!\n";
```

:::caution Backslash
Note that we used the **backslash** (`\n`), and not the forward slash (`/n`).
:::

This is how the program is being executed when we add newline characters:

<GoogleSlides
		src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRtT6R8wewyaM8WZRUP-KIREO_1HEdReq-BhpmUYKsVWRm5VbRRn7jZbhZyMIZMVzarQ1xkGrjS2eoM/embed"
		aspectRatio={960 / 500}
		delay={500}
		centered
	/>

:::important Newline Character
The `\n` sequence represents a **single character** for the program.
More on that later.
:::

### Prefix of the standard namespace

`std::` is the prefix of the **standard library namespace** from which `cout` comes.

Beginners often find typing `std::` to be unwieldy. It can be omitted if we give the appropriate line of code beforehand:

```cpp title="The 'using' statement" showLineNumbers
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	// highlight-next-line
	using std::cout;
	cout << "Hello, World!";
}
```

After the line that contains `using std::cout;`, the `std::` prefix is no longer needed to use `cout`.
It lasts until the end of the current code block (the `main` function in this case).

:::caution using namespace std
In many other online tutorials and sources, it is extremely common to find usage of

```cpp
using namespace std;
```

at the top of your file. While this is legal code in C++, it is **strongly discouraged** by nearly all experienced C++ programmers.
We will cover reasons for this later. For the time being, prefer the `using std::cout;` approach we mentioned before.
:::

## Performing calculations

Programming is used to automate certain activities.
For example, we can have a computer do math for us:

<Columns spacing={40} columns={['7fr', '5fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="main.cpp"
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	std::cout << "120 * 120 + 540";
}
```

</div>
<div>

```plaintext title="Result (console)"
120 * 120 + 540
```

</div>
</Columns>

Pay attention to the result of the above program!

:::info Text vs Instructions
Everything in quotation marks is treated as text, not instructions.
:::

Therefore, instead of displaying the result of the calculation, we got what we entered in the quotation marks.
To say that we want to perform some calculation, we need to remove the quotes:

<Columns spacing={40} columns={['7fr', '5fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="main.cpp"
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
	std::cout << 120 * 120 + 540;
}
```

</div>
<div>

```plaintext title="Result (console)"
14940
```

</div>
</Columns>

After starting the program, we will get the correct result of the calculation in the code.

### Mathematical operators

- `+` adds two numbers together
- `-` subtracts two numbers from each other
- `*` multiplies two numbers by itself
- `/` divides two numbers by itself
- `()` parentheses order operations

C++ adheres to the "PEMDAS" order you may have learned in school.

1. First Parentheses
2. Then Multiplication/Division from left to right
3. Finally Addition/Subtraction from left to right

## Summary

You've learned about the structure of the first program's code.
