# Special methods

There are two kinds of methods with a special meaning in C++: **constructors** and **destructors**.

## Constructors

:::important Definition
A constructor is a special method that is called when an object is created - it begins the lifetime of an object.
:::

One of the main reasons for using constructors is to set up the data members of an object based on external parameters.
For example, when creating a `Player` object, a constructor can be used to enforce that the health value passed to the constructor
is between `0` and the `maxHealth` value. The constructor can be defined as follows:

```cpp
struct Player
{
    int maxHealth;
    int health;

    Player(int maxHp, int hp)
	{
		maxHealth = maxHp;
		health = std::max(std::min(hp, maxHealth), 0);
    }
};
```

This constructor uses the `max` and `min` functions to ensure that `health` is between `0` and `maxHealth`.
This way, even if user try to pass `hp` more than `maxHealth` it will automatically be clamped to `maxHealth`.

:::important Defining a constructor
Constructors are defined by creating a function with the same name as the class, and without a return type (not even `void`).
:::

It is possible to define multiple constructors for a class or struct in C++, each with their own unique signature and behavior.
These constructors can take different forms such as:

- default constructors
- copy constructors
- move constructors

and more, which will be covered later in the course. Object construction in C++ is a vast topic and there are many advanced features and techniques.
In this lesson, we will only cover the basics of constructors and how they can be used to control the initialization of objects.

Depending on the context and how an object is constructed, a specific constructor will be called. This allows for greater
flexibility and control over the initialization of objects.

For now, let's start with the simplest form of a constructor.

### Default constructor

A default constructor in C++ is a constructor that can be called without any arguments. It is <Tooltip title={<>
	There are exceptions to this rule.
	There are situations where compiler cannot automatically generate it, but we will explain them later.
</>}>automatically provided\*</Tooltip> by the compiler when no other constructors are defined, but it can also be explicitly defined.

For example, the following `Person` struct has a default constructor:

```cpp title="Defining a default constructor"
struct Person {
    std::string name;
    int age;

	// Default settings
    Person() {
		name = "John Doe";
		age = 18;
	}
};
```

It can also be only declared within the struct body and then defined outside of it, like regular methods. For example:

```cpp title="Defining a constructor outside of the struct"
struct Person {
    std::string name;
    int age;

    Person(); // declaration only
};

// definition
Person::Person() {
    name = "John Doe";
    age = 18;
}
```

Note that the data members in the previous example of `Person`` struct could have been easily initialized **without** manually
writing a constructor. In earlier lessons, we have seen that we can use an assignment operator in the place of a data member declaration,
as a shorthand notation:

```cpp title="Shorthand notation for data member initialization"
struct Person {
	std::string name = "John Doe";
	int age = 18;
};
```

This is because in this case the compiler automatically generates a proper constructor for us, but in this lesson we wanted to demonstrate
that we can write it manually and possibly add an additional logic to it, just like in the example at the very beginning.
The ability to write a custom default constructor (or constructors in general) gives us more control over how objects are constructed and initialized,
and can help ensure that objects are created in a valid state.

:::tip
As a general rule of thumb, you should **only** write a constructor if you need to add some additional logic to it,
or if you want to enforce some constraints on the data members of an object. See [examples](#examples) to get a better idea of when to use them.
:::

### Parameterized constructor

A parametrized constructor is one that accepts one or more arguments. This allows for greater flexibility in the initialization of objects.
We used it in the example at the [beginning of this lesson](#constructors) to enforce that the `health` value passed to the constructor
is between `0` and the `maxHealth` value.

To instantiate an object using a parametrized constructor, we need to pass the required arguments to the constructor, like this:

```cpp
// prism-push-types:Player
Player player(100, 50); // maxHealth = 100, health = 50
```

#### A deleted default constructor

If we only provide a single, parametrized constructor, the **compiler will delete** the default one.
This is the case for our previous code. Trying to create a `Player` object without passing any arguments will result in a compiler error:

```cpp title="Trying to use a deleted default constructor"
// error-next-line
// prism-push-types:Player
Player player; // error: no matching function for call to 'Player::Player()'
```

To restore the default constructor, we can use the `default` keyword like this:

```cpp
struct Player {
	// <data members>

	Player(int maxHp, int hp) {
		// ...
	}

	Player() = default; // enforce compiler to create a default constructor
};
```

#### Copy constructor

:::danger Invalid copy constructor
Declaring a constructor with a single parameter of the same type as the structure is not allowed:

```cpp
// error-next-line
// prism-push-types:Person
Person(Person other) { // error
	// ...
}
```
