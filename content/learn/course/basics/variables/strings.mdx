# Strings

In this lesson, you will learn how to use variables that store text.
As humans, text is the primary medium through which we interact with computer programs.
Learning basic text storage and manipulation is crucial to making functional applications that people can and want to use.

## Motivation

The world runs on text. Variables that can store text turn out to quite useful because of this.
Consider a program which reads the user's name, then greets them with the number of characters in their name.

```cpp title="üîπ Program that loads a name"
#include <iostream>
// highlight-next-line
#include <string>

int main()
{
	// highlight-next-line
	std::string name;
	std::cout << "Enter your name: ";
	//highlight-next-line
	std::cin >> name;
	std::cout << "Welcome, " << name << "!\n";
	std::cout << "Your name has " << name.size() << " characters.\n";
}
```

## A type for storing text

In previous lessons, we talked about different types of variables, though we focused on those
that store numbers. We mentioned the `char` type, which stores
**a single character**.

In programming, text is a series of characters ‚Å†‚Äî known as a **string**.
C++ provides us with the type [`std::string`](/docs/std/containers/strings/string) to store and manipulate strings.

:::important Header file
You must include the `string` header to use `std::string` in your code,
in the same way as we did earlier with `iostream`:

```cpp
#include <string>
```
:::

The `std::string` type is used just like any other.
Here, we make two variables ‚Äî one of type `int`, and another of type `std::string`:

```cpp
int number;
std::string text;
```

### Initialization

Assigning the initial value is the same as for variables of other types,
but note that text is specified between **double quotes**, not single quotes:

```cpp title="üîπ Initializing and outputting a string variable"
std::string welcome = "Hello, World!";
std::cout << welcome;
```

If no value is given, the string will be *empty*. The text is length 0,
and printing it to the console will show nothing.

## String operations

### User interaction

We can display the strings using `std::cout` and load them using `std::cin`.

```cpp title="üîπ A welcome message"
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
	std::string name;
	std::cout << "Enter your name: ";
	std::cin >> name;
	std::cout << "Welcome, " << name << "!\n";
}
```

Note that `std::cin` takes the input text until it encounters the first whitespace character, such as a space, tab, or newline.
Because of this, if we enter our first and last name, only the first name will go into the `name` variable.
To get the whole line of text, you can use `std::getline`:

```cpp title="üîπ Reading a whole line of text"
std::string fullName;
std::getline(std::cin, fullName);
```

`std::getline` is a *function* that takes two arguments - an *input stream* to read the line from, and an `std::string` variable to store the line in.
This example shows how you can use this function to read a line from `std::cin`. 
So, this function is "called" by putting the name of the function `std::getline`, then parentheses `(...)`, and inside the parentheses the 
arguments we want to provide `std::cin, fullName`.

### Combinging Strings

The `+` and `+=` operators can be used to *concatenate* and *append* strings together.
Consider the following abridged example with an input of `Dwayne Johnson`:

<Columns columns={['2fr', '1fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="üîπ Concatenation and Appending"
std::string firstName;
std::string lastName;

std::cin >> firstName;
std::cin >> lastName;

// Concatenation
// highlight-next-line
std::string coolName = firstName + " \"The Rock\" " + lastName;
std::cout << "Your cool name is:\n" << coolName << "\n\n";

// Appending
// highlight-next-line
coolName += " Mk II";
std::cout << "Your new name is:\n" << coolName;
```
</div>
<div>

```plaintext title="Result"
Your cool name is:
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson

Your new name is:
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson Mk II
```
</div>
</Columns>

Notice how `coolName` is the result of *concatenating* three strings - `firstName`, `"The Rock"`, and `lastName`.
Then, see how we modify `coolName` by *appending* `" Mk II"` to it.

### Reading the length

To check how many characters are in a string we use the so-called *method* `size`.
We'll talk more about functions and methods later in the course, as they are a very important concept.

Let's see how to use the `size` method in practice. Consider the following example with an input of `Johnny`:

<Columns columns={['2fr', '1fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="üîπ Program that counts the size of a name"
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
	std::string name;
	std::cout << "Enter your name: ";
	std::cin >> name;

	std::cout << "\nWelcome, " << name << "!\n";
	// highlight-next-line
	std::cout << "Your name has " << name.size() << " characters.\n";
}
```
</div>
<div>

```plaintext title="Result"
Welcome, Johnny!
Your name has 6 characters.
```
</div>
</Columns>

We call the `size` method by doing `name.size()`. The `.` indicates that we are accessing something on
our `name` variable. `size` is the name of the method we are accessing. The `()` *calls* the `size` method.
This gives back to us the total number of characters in the string. These terms aren't crucial to remember now,
but you will see them later in the Functions and Methods lessons; just remember how to use it.

Just to reiterate, we specify the variable (`name`), then we write `size` after the period and then **empty** round brackets:

```cpp title="üîπ Calling the size method"
name.size()
```

### Conversions between numbers and strings

Numbers and strings cannot be freely converted to each other without a specialized *function* that does it for us.
This is because number types and string types in C++ are disinctly **different**, and not generally compatible.
While it may be annoying, this is actually very important for making bug-free code.

```cpp
53
"53"
```

The first value is the arithmetic number `53`. It represents a value that we can perform mathematical operations on.
The second value is text consisting of the characters `'5'` and `'3'`. We can't perform math on strings; rather,
the string operations we can perform are concatenations.

These are the incorrect ways of trying to convert between strings and numbers, all causing compilation errors:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="bad1" label="‚ùå Incorrect" default>

```cpp title="‚ùå Assigning a number variable into a string"
int number = 53;
// error-next-line
std::string str	= number; // Error
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="bad2" label="‚ùå Incorrect">

```cpp title="‚ùå Assigning an integer literal into a string"
// error-next-line
std::string str	= 53; // Error
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="bad3" label="‚ùå Incorrect">

```cpp title="‚ùå Assigning an string into a number"
std::string str	= "53";
// error-next-line
int number = str; // Error
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="bad4" label="‚ùå Incorrect">

```cpp title="‚ùå Assigning an string literal into a number"
// error-next-line
int number = "53"; // Error
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

To convert from a number type (like `int` or `float`) to string, we need to use the `std::to_string` function.

```cpp title="‚úî Converting a number to a text"
int number = 53;
std::string numberInStr	= std::to_string(number);
```

In the same way, if we have a number stored inside a string, we can
convert it to an `int` with `std::stoi` (_**s**tring **to** **i**nt_) and
to `float` type with `std::stof` (_**s**tring **to** **f**loat_):

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="stoi" label="üîµ std::stoi" default>

```cpp title="Convert std::string to int"
std::string numberInStr = "53";
int number = std::stoi(numberInStr);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="stof" label="üü£ std::stof">

```cpp title="Convert std::string to float"
std::string numberInStr = "53.5"; // do not put `f` at the end in the text
float number = std::stof(numberInStr);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Summary

In this lesson, we learned about the `std::string` type, which is a type that represents a sequence of characters.
