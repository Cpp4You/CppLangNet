# Strings

In this lesson, you will learn how to use variables that store text.

## Motivation

Text type variables are quite useful. An example would be a program which
reads the user's name, then greets him with the number of characters in his name.

```cpp title="🔹 Program that loads a name"
#include <iostream>
// highlight-next-line
#include <string>

int main()
{
	// highlight-next-line
	std::string name;
	std::cout << "Enter your name: ";
	std::cin >> name;
	std::cout << "Welcome, " << name << "!\n";
	std::cout << "Your name has " << name.size() << " characters.\n";
}
```

## Type for storing text

In previous lessons, we talked about different types of variables, mainly those
that store numbers. We also mentioned the `char' type, which stores
**a single character**.

In programming, text is referred to as a *string of characters*.
In C++, there is a type that allows us to store such strings, and it is [`std::string`](/docs/std/containers/strings/string).

:::caution Header file
To be able to use `std::string` properly we **must** add the `string` header to the code,
in the same way as we did earlier with `iostream`:

```cpp
#include <string>
```
:::

The `std::string` type is used just like any other, that is:

```cpp title="🔹 Using the string type"
int number;
std::string text;
```

### Initialization

Assigning the initial value is the same as for variables of other types,
but note that **text is specified between double quotes**, not single quotes:

```cpp
std::string welcome = "Hello, World!";
std::cout << welcome;
```

If no value is given, the variable will be a string of length 0, i.e. it will be empty text.

## String operations

### User interaction

We can display the strings using `std::cout` and load them using `std::cin`.

```cpp title="🔹 Name reading and welcome message"
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
	std::string name;
	std::cout << "Enter your name: ";
	std::cin >> name;
	std::cout << "Welcome, " << name << "!\n";
}
```

Note that `std::cin` takes the text until it encounters the first whitespace character, such as a space.
Because of this, if we enter our first and last name, only the first name will go into the `name` variable.
To get the whole line of text we write:

```cpp title="🔹 Reading a whole line of text"
std::string name;
std::getline(std::cin, name);
```

### Appending

To append some text to the end of a string, we can use the `+=` operator:

```cpp
std::string name = "John";
name += " Smith";

std::cout << name;
```

If we play around with the order of operations, using the `=` and `+` operators we can
add a piece of text to the beginning:

```cpp
std::string name = "John";
// highlight-next-line
name = "Smith " + name;

std::cout << name;
```

### Reading the length

To check how many characters are in a string we use the so-called *method* `size`.
We'll talk more about functions and methods later in the course, for now remember that
we use them like this:

```cpp title="🔹 Program that loads a name"
#include <iostream>
// highlight-next-line
#include <string>

int main()
{
	// highlight-next-line
	std::string name;
	std::cout << "Enter your name: ";
	std::cin >> name;
	std::cout << "Welcome, " << name << "!\n";
	std::cout << "Your name has " << name.size() << " characters.\n";
}
```

that is, we specify the variable (`name`), then we write `size` after the period and then **empty** round brackets:

```cpp title="🔹 Calling the size method"
name.size()
```

### Retreiving a substring

Analogous to the `size` method, we can retrieve a portion of the string using the `substr` method:

```cpp title="🔹 Calling the substr method"
std::string name = "John Smith";
std::cout << name.substr(0, 4);
```

Zauważ, że w nawiasach okrągłych podajemy zakres znaków, które chcemy uzyskać:

```cpp
substr( [starting position], [count] )
```

that is, in the case above, we copy three characters starting at position `0`.

:::caution Indexing
In the strings, we count characters from `0`, not from `1`. The first character is located at position `0`.
:::

### Converting numbers to strings

Because of the way the program stores numbers and text, these values
are not convertible between them by default. To understand this, we need to be able to distinguish between
these two things:

```cpp
53
"53"
```

The first value is the number 53, and the second is a text consisting of the characters `'5'` and `'3'`.
If we want to convert the number `53` to text form, we **cannot** do it this way:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="bad1" label="❌ Incorrect" default>

```cpp
int number = 53;
std::string numberInStr	= number; // Error
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="bad2" label="❌ Incorrect">

```cpp
std::string numberInStr	= 53; // Error
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


Instead, we must use the so-called `std::to_string` function (we'll talk about functions later in the course).
It is done in this way:

```cpp title="✔ Converting a number to a text"
int number = 53;
std::string numberInStr	= std::to_string(number);
```

In the same way, if we have a number stored inside a string, we can
convert it to an `int` with `std::stoi` (_**s**tring **to** **i**nt_) and
to `float` type with `std::stof` (_**s**tring **to** **f**loat_):

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="stoi" label="🔵 std::stoi" default>

Convert `std::string` to `int`:
```cpp
std::string numberInStr = "53";
int number = std::stoi(numberInStr);
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="stof" label="🟣 std::stof">

Convert `std::string` to `float`:
```cpp
std::string numberInStr = "53.5"; // do not put `f` at the end in the text
float number = std::stof(numberInStr);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
