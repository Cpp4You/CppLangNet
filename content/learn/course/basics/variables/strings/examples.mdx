## Personal details

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
	// Setup the four variables we will read the user's information into
	std::string firstName;
	std::string lastName;
	std::string favoriteColor;
	int age;

	// Ask the user 4 questions and store their answers
	std::cout << "What is your first name? ";
	std::cin >> firstName;

	std::cout << "What is your last name? ";
	std::cin >> lastName;

	std::cout << "What is your age? ";
	std::cin >> age;

	std::cout << "What is your favorite color? ";
	std::cin >> favoriteColor;

	// Output the user's information whilst calculating the difference between their age and first name's length
	std::cout << "\n\nWelcome, " << firstName << " " << lastName << "!\n";
	std::cout << "You are " << age << " years old, and your favorite color is " << favoriteColor << "\n";
	std::cout << "There are " << firstName.size() << " characters in your first name... ";
	std::cout << (age - firstName.size()) << " less than your age!\n";
}
```

## Team Name

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
	std::string animal;
	std::string adjective;
	int teamSize;

	std::cout << "I'm going to help you make a team name!\n";

	std::cout << "Enter an animal: ";
	std::cin >> animal;

	std::cout << "Enter an adjective: ";
	std::cin >> adjective;

	std::cout << "Enter the size of the team: ";
	std::cin >> teamSize;

	// Form the team name by concatenating the three answers we have so far
	std::string teamName = adjective + animal + std::to_string(teamSize);
	std::cout << "Your current team name is \"" << teamName << "\"!";

	std::string pluralNoun;
	std::cout << "Enter a plural noun: ";
	std::cin >> pluralNoun;

	// Finalize the team name by appending the plural noun
	teamName += " sans " + pluralNoun;
	std::cout << "Your final team name is \"" << teamName << "\"!";
}
```

## Numbers and Strings

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
	int a;
	int b;

	std::cout << "Input two numbers: ";
	std::cin >> a >> b;

	int sum = a + b;
	// Use an int-to-string conversion to concatenate the two numbers
	std::string concatStr = std::to_string(a) + std::to_string(b);

	std::cout << "Their sum is " << sum << " and their concatenation is " << concatStr << "\n";

	// Perform a string-to-int conversion and compute the difference
	int concatVal = std::stoi(concatStr);
	int diff = concatVal - sum;

	std::cout << "Their difference is " << diff;
}
```
