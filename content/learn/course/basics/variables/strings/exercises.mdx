Lord Mux has returned with another request. He would like to see how good we are at naming rocketships.
Your task is to build a C++ program that generates a spaceship name adhering to the following format:

`Digi-[MISSION NO] [CODENAME] Mk. [REVISION]`

However, due to the poor attention span of the Muxian population, you are only allowed to 
ask the user two questions. 

The first question shall ask for the **CODENAME**, which can be any single word.

The second question shall ask for a **MODIFIER**, which should be a single whole number.

You will generate the remaining two parameters by the following rules:

**MISSION NO** - The number of characters in **CODENAME** concatenated with the string representation of **MODIFIER**.
For example, if **CODENAME** is `Raven` and **MODIFIER** is `20`, then **MISSION NO** should be `520`.

**REVISION** - The integral value of **MISSION NO** multiplied by 16 (as Muxians have 16 fingers to count on).

**Additional requirements** The final name of the rocketship should be stored in a single `std::string` variable
before being output to the terminal.

### Example Execution
```plaintext
Welcome to the Rocketship Name Generator 9000!

Enter a CODENAME: Raven
Enter a MODIFIER: 20

Your new rocketship name is:
Digi-520 Raven Mk. 8320
```

## Hints

If you are stuck on generating **CODENAME** or **MODIFIER**, see example [Personal details](../examples/#personal-details).

If you are stuck on generating **MISSION NO**, see example [Team Name](../examples/#team-name).

If you are stuck on generating **REVISION**, see example [Numbers and Strings](../examples/#numbers-and-strings).
