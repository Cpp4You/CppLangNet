# Operations on variables

In this lesson, you will learn to perform various operations with variables by:
- Writing values to them
- Modifying them with mathematical expressions
- Displaying their contents in the console

You will also learn how to enable simple user interaction with the program.

### User interaction

Our programs become more interesting when we let the user interact with them.
We will do this by adding a new instruction using `cin` (_**c**haracter **in**put_):

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Please enter your age: ";
	
	int age;
	// highlight-next-line
	std::cin >> age;

	std::cout << "You're " << age << " years old.\n";
}
```

`cin` allows us to save the content of the so-called "standard input" (stdin)
to the variable that is passed after the `>>` characters. 
This allows the user to type something into the console, and then that value is placed into a variable.

Please note that:
- `cout` uses the `<<` operator
- `cin` uses the `>>` operator

In addition, you can see that we didn't assign an initial value to `age`.
The initial value is not needed because we use `std::cin` immediately after we create the variable,
which assings a value to the variable. After which, the variable is now *initialized*.

:::tip Remember
You can remember the direction of the arrows in an easy way

- `cout` - the text goes **to the console** - `<<` pointing to the `cout`
- `cin` -  the text goes **to the variable** - `>>` pointing to the variable
:::

### Math operations

Variables that store numbers can be freely modified using typical mathematical notation (operators):

<center>
	<SymbolTable noTraits>
		<tr>
			<th>Operation</th>
			<th>Meaning</th>
		</tr>
		<Symbol name="a + b" desc="Adds a and b" />
		<Symbol name="a - b" desc="Subtracts b from a" />
		<Symbol name="a * b" desc="Multiplies a and b" />
		<Symbol name="a / b" desc="Divides the number a by b" />
		<Symbol name="a % b" desc="Remainder of the division a by b" />
	</SymbolTable>
</center>

:::note
These are not all math operators. We'll talk about the rest later.
:::

:::caution
The `^` symbol is **not** exponentiation!
:::

Let's see these operators in practice:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Please enter your age: ";

	int age;
	std::cin >> age;

	// highlight-start
	std::cout << "In 10 years, you'll be "					<< (age + 10)	<< " years old\n";
	std::cout << "5 years ago, you were "					<< (age - 5)	<< " years old\n";
	std::cout << "When you are twice as old, you'll be "	<< (age * 2)	<< " years old\n";
	std::cout << "Someone twice as young is "				<< (age / 2)	<< " years old\n";
	std::cout << (age % 10) << " years ago your age was divisible by 10";
	// highlight-end
}
```

:::tip Alignment
Note that it doesn't matter whether you use **`Space`** or **`Tab`** to align code.
:::

None of the aforementioned operators will affect the variable they're used on.
**The content of `age` does not change**.

By entering the age `20`, we will get the following result:

<Columns columns={['2fr', '1fr']}>
<div>

```plaintext title="Console"
In 10 years, you'll be 30 years old
5 years ago, you were 15 years old
When you are twice as old, you'll be 40 years old
Someone twice as young is 10 years old
0 years ago your age was divisible by 10
```

</div>

<div>

```plaintext title="Description"
(age: 20 => + 10 = 30)
(age: 20 => - 5  = 30)
(age: 20 => * 2  = 40)
(age: 20 => / 2  = 10)
(age: 20 => % 10 =  0)
```

</div>
</Columns>

As we can see, the value of the variable `age` remained the same at each step (keeping a value of `20` the entire time).  
This is because in the notation:

```cpp
a + b
```

The `a + b` expression **results** in some value and **the contents of the variables are left untouched**.  

### Modifying variables

Often times, we will want to change a variable's value by giving it a new one.
You can simply use the assignment operator `=` again on a variable to give it a new value.

In the following example, the variable `age` is initially created with a value of `20`.
Then, we *assign* a new value of `37` to it.

```cpp
int age = 20;
//highlight-next-line
age = 37;
```

If, for example, we want to increase a variable by `10`, we have to assign the result
of an addition expression like so:

```cpp
age = age + 10;
```

As this pattern is so common, C++ provides a shorthand syntax for this:

```cpp
age += 10;
```

And you can see how it works in the example below:

<Columns columns={['2fr', '1fr']}>
<div>

<CustomCodeBlock>

```cpp title="ðŸ”¹ main.cpp" showLineNumbers
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Please enter your age: ";

	// highlight-start
	int age;
	std::cin >> age;
	// highlight-end

	std::cout << "You're now " << age << " years old\n";
	// highlight-start
	age += 30;
	std::cout << "In 30 years, you'll be " << age << " years old";
	// highlight-end
}
```

</CustomCodeBlock>

</div>

<div>

```plaintext title="Result"
You're now 20 years old
In 30 years, you'll be 50 years old
```

</div>
</Columns>

Let's analyze the steps this program took in order. Consider the variable `age`:

- Line `7` defines a variable called `age` of type `int` with no initial value.
- When line `8` is executed, the program waits at this point until the user types something in and presses **`Enter`**.
	- Once the input is received, `std::cin` places the value it read into `age`. Since we typed in `20`, `age` is now `20`.
- When line `10` is executed, `std::cout` prints out the value of `age`, which is still 20.
- Line `11` changes the value to the result of `20 + 30`, which is `50`. `age` now has a value of  `50`.
- Finally, Line `12` is executed, which displays a value `50`

In addition to the operator `+=` presented above, there are many other operators available
that modify the content of variables; here are the most common ones:

<center>
	<SymbolTable noTraits>
		<tr>
			<th>Shorthand Operator</th>
			<th>Equivalent To</th>
		</tr>
		<Symbol name="a += b" desc="a = a + b" />
		<Symbol name="a -= b" desc="a = a - b" />
		<Symbol name="a *= b" desc="a = a * b" />
		<Symbol name="a /= b" desc="a = a / b" />
	</SymbolTable>
</center>

And a presentation of these operators in action:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="presentation" label="Presentation" default>

Below is a presentation of the program's operation, after entering the number `20`.

	number -= 10;
	std::cout << "Now, after decreasing by 10: " << number << '\n';

	// Multiply by 3 and assign.
	number *= 3;

	// Divide by 2 and assign.
	number /= 2;
	std::cout << "Now, after dividing by 2: " << number << '\n';

	// Increase value by 1 (incrementation):
	number++;
	std::cout << "Now, after incrementation: " << number << '\n';

	// Decrease value by 1 (decrementation):
	number--;
	std::cout << "Now, after decrementation: " << number << '\n';
}
```
