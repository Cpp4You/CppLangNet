# Operations on variables

In this lesson, you will learn to perform various operations with variables. We will:
- write values to them,
- modify them with mathematical expressions,
- display their contents in the console.

You will also learn to allow the user a simple interaction with the program.

### User interaction

Our programs will be a bit more interesting when we let the user type
something into the console.  
We will do by adding a new instruction using `cin` (_**c**haracter **in**put_):

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Please enter your age: ";
	
	int age;
	// highlight-next-line
	std::cin >> age;

	std::cout << "You're " << age << " years old.\n";
}
```

`cin` allows us to save the content of the so-called standard input (stdin)
to the variable that is passed after the characters `>>`.

We'll talk about standard input at another time, for now remember that
`cin` allows the user of the program to type something from the console,
then writes that value to a variable.

Please not that:
- `cout` uses the `<<` operator
- `cin` uses the `>>` operator

In addition to that, you can see that we didn't assign an initial value to `age`.
It is not needed, because immediately after its creation, we use `std::cin`
that assings the value that the user enters from the keyboard.

:::tip Remember
You can remember the direction of the stamps in this operator in an easy way

- `cout` - the text goes **to the console** - `<<` pointing to the `cout`
- `cin` -  the text goes **to the variable** - `>>` pointing to the variable
:::

### Math operations

Variables that contain numbers can be freely modified using typical mathematical signs (operators):

- `a + b` - adds two numbers together
- `a - b` - subtracts two numbers from each other
- `a * b` - multiplies two numbers by itself
- `a / b` - divides the number `a` by `b`
- `a % b` - remainder of division `a` by `b`

:::note
These are not all math operators. We'll talk about the rest later.
:::

Let's use these operators in practice:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Please enter your age: ";

	int age;
	std::cin >> age;

	// highlight-start
	std::cout << "In 10 years, you'll be "					<< (age + 10)	<< " years old\n";
	std::cout << "5 years ago, you were "					<< (age - 5)	<< " years old\n";
	std::cout << "When you are twice as old, you'll be "	<< (age * 2)	<< " years old\n";
	std::cout << "Someone twice as young is "				<< (age / 2)	<< " years old\n";
	std::cout << (age % 10) << " years ago your age was divisible by 10";
	// highlight-end
}
```

:::tip Alignment
Note that it doesn't matter to the compiler whether we use a single space or align the code
with the **`Tab`** key.
:::

A very important fact is that the use of the above-mentioned operators
**does not change the content of the variable** `age`.

By entering the age `20`, we will get the following result:

<Columns columns={['2fr', '1fr']}>
<div>

```plaintext title="Console"
In 10 years, you'll be 30 years old
5 years ago, you were 15 years old
When you are twice as old, you'll be 40 years old
Someone twice as young is 10 years old
0 years ago your age was divisible by 10
```

</div>

<div>

```plaintext title="Description"
(age: 20 => + 10 = 30)
(age: 20 => - 5 = 30)
(age: 20 => * 2 = 40)
(age: 20 => / 2 = 10)
(age: 20 => % 10 = 0)
```

</div>
</Columns>

As we can see, the value of the variable `age` remained the same at each stage (having value of `20`).  
This is because in the notation:

```cpp
a + b
```

the `a + b` expression **results** in some value and the contents of the **variables are left untouched**.  

If, for example, we want to increase a variable by `10`, we have to assign the result
value of this expression to it:

```cpp
age = age + 10;
```

... or in short:

```cpp
age += 10;
```

See how it works on an example (I type `20` into the console again):

<Columns columns={['2fr', '1fr']}>
<div>

<CustomCodeBlock lineNumbers>

```cpp title="🔹 main.cpp"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Please enter your age: ";

	int age;
	std::cin >> age;

	std::cout << "You're now " << age << " years old\n";
	// highlight-start
	age += 30;
	std::cout << "In 30 years, you'll be " << age << " years old";
	// highlight-end
}
```

</CustomCodeBlock>

</div>

<div>

```plaintext title="Result"
You're now 20 years old
In 30 years, you'll be 50 years old
```

</div>
</Columns>

### Program execution flow

Variable `age`:

- when the line `11` is executed, it has the value `20`.
- the line`12` changes the value to `20 + 30` that is `50`
- on the line `13` is displayed with the value `50`

### Modifying variables

In addition to the operator presented above: `+=`, there are many other operators available
that modify the content of variables.

The easiest way to show them is an example:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="presentation" label="Presentation" default>

Below is a presentation of the program's operation, after entering the number `20`.

```cpp title="🔹 main.cpp"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Enter some number: ";

	int number;
	std::cin >> number;

	// Increase "number" by 5 and assign.
	number += 5;
	std::cout << "After increasing by 5: " << number << '\n';

	// Decrease "number" by 10 and assign.
	number -= 10;
	std::cout << "Now, after decreasing by 10: " << number << '\n';

	// Multiply by 3 and assign.
	number *= 3;
	std::cout << "Now, after multiplying by 3: " << number << '\n';

	// Divide by 2 and assign.
	number /= 2;
	std::cout << "Now, after dividing by 2: " << number << '\n';

	// Increase value by 1 (incrementation):
	number++;
	std::cout << "Now, after incrementation: " << number << '\n';

	// Decrease value by 1 (decrementation):
	number--;
	std::cout << "Now, after decrementation: " << number << '\n';
}
```

</CustomCodeBlock>
</TabItem>

</Tabs>
