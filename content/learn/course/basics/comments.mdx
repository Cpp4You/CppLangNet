# Comments

Comments are used to add descriptions and explanations to the code.

## Motivation

Comments often show the developer intent when the code is complex.
They are also very useful in a situation like right now when you are
reading this course and I can use them to explain things ðŸ˜„

:::caution
Comments **do not** affect the operation of the program in any way.
They are completely ignored during compilation.
:::

## Types of comments

There are single line comments:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	// this is a single line comment
	// it starts with "//"
	// and ends with the end of the line
	std::cout << "Hello, World!";
}
```

... and multi-line comments:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	/*	this is a multi-line comment
		it starts with "/" followed directly by "*"
		and ends with "*" followed directly by "/"
	*/
	std::cout << "Hello, World!";
}
```

## Good practices

Use comments when you find that the code does not describe the intent well enough.
You will understand what I am talking about as you learn
new things from the C++ language.

:::tip Language (for non-english speakers)
It's best to use English to write comments.
It doesn't really matter at first, but it's definitely worth getting into the habit
of writing in English, because in the future, someone else may also use your code ðŸ˜ƒ

**Comment on your code but don't overdo it.**
