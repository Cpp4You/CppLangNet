# Structures

In this lesson, you will learn how to create data types composed of multiple
smaller elements - what we call structures in C++.

## Motivation

For example, if we want to include enemies in our program when creating a game 🎮,
we usually need to store some information about each of them.

Think about what data about enemies in a game might be useful? This could be, for example:

- name 👾
- health points 💚
- strength 💪

etc.

Using the knowledge we have gained so far, if we wanted to write a program that stores this
information, we could do it like this:

```cpp
#include <string>

int main() {
	std::string enemy_name = "Goblin";
	float enemy_health = 50;
	float enemy_strength = 12;
	// ...
}
```

When we want to have more enemies in the game, we will encounter a problem,
or rather an inconvenience:

If we use multiple arrays for this purpose:

```cpp
std::vector< std::string > enemy_names;
std::vector< float > enemy_health;
std::vector< float > enemy_strength;
```

then each opponent will be described under the same index in these arrays:

- `enemy_names[ index ]` describes the name
- `enemy_health[ index ]` describes health points
- `enemy_strength[ index ]` describes the strength

The consequence of using this method is the "scattering" of information about one enemy across multiple arrays.
Then adding one enemy to the collection in such a program would look like this:

```cpp
enemy_names.push_back("Goblin");
enemy_health.push_back(50);
enemy_strength.push_back(10);
```

The more information about our enemies we want to store, the more cumbersome
it will be. Fortunately, **structures** come to our aid.

## Terminology

- **Structure** is a recipe for how to create an object (in this case, an enemy).
	It groups multiple variables into one whole.
- **Object** is a specific *instance* of a structure, e.g. a specific enemy.

			In C++, an object is an indirect way to access computer memory. It represents a memory area
			that stores data of a specific type. A simple variable of a fundamental type (e.g. `int`, `float`, etc.)
			is also an object, but in the context of this lesson we will use this term in relation to structures.
			A variable is an object with a name (identifier) that can be used to access its value.

## Creating structures

Let's recall what data we need to store:

- name
- health points
- strength

We are going to add a structure that will allow us to create an object containing these 3 things.

```cpp
#include <string>

struct Enemy
{
	std::string name;
	float health;
	float strength;
};

int main()
{
	// We leave it empty for now
}
```

The code above introduces a new **structure** - `Enemy`.

### Syntax

To create a structure, we write its name after the keyword `struct`, then we put its contents
between curly braces `{` and `}`.

In C++, a structure can contain:

- data members (variables)
- function members (methods)

and other, more advanced elements, which we will discuss later in the course.

<div id="semicolon-at-structure-end" />

:::danger Semicolon
Pay attention to the **mandatory** semicolon `;` after the curly braces closing the structure definition.

<details>
	<summary>Example</summary>
	<div>
		```cpp
		struct Enemy
		{
			std::string name;
			float health;
			float strength;
			// highlight-next-line
		};
		```
	</div>
</details>

:::

## Objects

To create variables of a specific type, we used the following syntax:

```cpp
// prism-push-types:Type
Type variable_name;
```

We use the same syntax to create an object of a structure type:

```cpp
int main()
{
	Enemy boss;
}
```

In this way, we included all these 3 members (`name`, `health` and `strength`) inside one variable `boss`.

Let's recall the terminology. Considering the code above, we say that `boss` is an object (instance) of type `Enemy`.
This means that the `Enemy` structure was used as a recipe to create the `boss` object.

### Accessing members

As mentioned above, `boss` contains 3 member fields.
To access a specific element of this object, we use the dot operator `.`:

```cpp title="Set the boss's name to 'Ogre'"
boss.name = "Ogre";

std::cout << boss.name; // Prints Ogre
```

In the same way, we can modify the enemy's *strength*:

```cpp title="Modifying object data"
boss.strength	= 50; // I set the boss's strength to 50

// Boss activates the "fury" skill - strength increases
// Health is halved
boss.strength += 25;
boss.health *= 0.5f;
```

... or display information about it:

<CustomCodeBlock fullCode={<FullCode_UsingObjectFields/>}>

```cpp title="Using object member data"
// prism-push-types:Enemy
// I create a boss object
Enemy boss;
// and assigns values to its members
boss.name = "Ogre";
boss.health = 250;
boss.strength = 50;

std::cout << boss.name << " has "
	<< boss.health << " hp and "
	<< boss.strength << " strength."
	<< std::endl;
```

</CustomCodeBlock>

### Passing objects to functions

There is nothing stopping us from creating a function that takes an object of a specific structure as a parameter.
A good example would be displaying information about the enemy:

```cpp title="Function that displays information about the enemy"
void print_enemy_info(Enemy enemy)
{
	std::cout << enemy.name << " has "
		<< enemy.health << " hp and "
		<< enemy.strength << " strength."
		<< std::endl;
}
```

:::danger Order
`print_enemy_info` requires that the `Enemy` type exists **before** the function itself is defined.
This means that we must place the function under the structure definition (see example below).
:::

Using the information above, we will create a "game" that will have two enemies:

- ordinary enemy 👹:  
**Goblin Warrior**, `60` health, `14` strength

- boss 💀:  
**Ogre**, `250` health, `50` strength

<CustomCodeBlock maxLines={25}>

```cpp title="Code fragment of a game with Ogre and Goblin" showLineNumbers
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// Creating a structure
struct Enemy
{
	std::string name;
	float health;
	float strength;
};

// Function that displays information about the enemy
void print_enemy_info(Enemy enemy)
{
	std::cout << enemy.name << " has "
		<< enemy.health << " hp and "
		<< enemy.strength << " strength."
		<< std::endl;
}

// Main function
int main()
{
	// I create boss and goblin objects
	Enemy boss;
	Enemy goblin;

	// I configure the fields of the goblin object
	goblin.name = "Goblin Warrior";
	goblin.health = 60;
	goblin.strength = 14;

	// I configure the fields of the boss object
	boss.name = "Ogre";
	boss.health = 250;
	boss.strength = 50;

	// and I display information about them
	print_enemy_info(goblin);
	print_enemy_info(boss);
}
```

</CustomCodeBlock>

### Objects inside arrays

We can put objects inside arrays just like regular variables:

```cpp title="Vector of enemies"
std::vector< Enemy > enemies;
```

Below is an example of how to add to such an array:

```cpp title="Adding objects to a vector"
// ...

int main()
{
	std::vector< Enemy > enemies;

	// (optional)
	// Code block to limit the scope
	// of local variables inside
	{
		// I create a goblin variable 👉 locally 👈
		Enemy goblin;
		// I configure the fields
		goblin.name = "Goblin Warrior";
		goblin.health = 60;
		goblin.strength = 14;

		// I add the object to the vector
		// highlight-next-line
		enemies.push_back( goblin );
	}
	// 👈 from this point on, the goblin exists ONLY inside the vector

	// Display each enemy in the vector
	for (Enemy enemy : enemies)
		print_enemy_info(enemy);
}
```

:::tip Example
After reading this lesson, review this example program: [**👾 Combat Arena**](../example-programs/combat-arena)
and its overview. There you will see how arrays and structures are used in practice.
:::

### Default values of data members

We can assign default values to structure elements, so we don't have to fill them in every time.

A good example of using a default value is a variable that stores the total amount of damage
that the enemy has dealt. To start with, for each enemy, this value will have to be equal to `0`.

:::caution Field initialization
If you leave a structure field without a default value, e.g.:
```cpp
struct Car
{
	int number_of_wheels;
};
```

it does not mean that `number_of_wheels` will be set to `0` when the object is created,
you have to do it **manually**!
:::

To assign a default value to a structure field, we use ordinary initialization,
known from creating variables:

```cpp title="Default value for 'total_damage' ⚔"
// Creating a structure
struct Enemy
{
	std::string name;
	float health;
	float strength;

	// highlight-next-line
	float total_damage = 0;
};
```

Now, when we create some enemy:

```cpp
// prism-push-types:Enemy
Enemy snake; // snake as an example
```

then the value of its `total_damage` field

```cpp
snake.total_damage
```

will be set automatically to `0`.

You can see this, for example, by printing it:

<Columns columns={['2fr', '1fr']}>
<div>

```cpp
int main() {
	Enemy snake;
	snake.name = "Snake";
	// 🟡 Note that I don't set "total_damage" manually

	std::cout << snake.name
		<< " dealt a total of "
		<< snake.total_damage
		<< " damage\n";
}
```

</div>
<div>

```plaintext title="Result"
Snake dealt a total of 0 damage
```

</div>
</Columns>

## Functions in a structure

Structures can also contain functions, which we call **methods**. They are associated with the object on which they are called.

<Image center
		maxheight={250}
		alt="Presentation of the enemy and its actions - Goblin"
		src="/img/tutorials/course/basic/structures/goblin-struct-data-and-methods.gif"
		desc={<>Goblin image by <a href="https://luizmelo.itch.io/monsters-creatures-fantasy">LuizMelo</a></>}
	/>
<br/>

Consider our goblin example. We can add methods to the `Enemy` structure that represent an action
that this enemy can perform, e.g. attacking, defending, or running away.

```cpp title="Adding methods to the structure"
struct Enemy
{
	std::string name;
	float health;
	float strength;

	// highlight-start
	void attack()
	{
		// Attack logic
		std::cout << name << " attacks with " << strength << " strength.\n";
	}

	void defend()
	{
		// Defense logic
		std::cout << name << " defends with " << health << " hp.\n";
	}

	void run_away()
	{
		// Escape logic
		std::cout << name << " retreats with " << health << " health points.\n";
	}
	// highlight-end
};
```

In the example above, we added three methods to the `Enemy` structure: `attack`, `defend`, and `run_away`.
Each of them prints a message to the console, simulating the execution of a given action. Member functions receive the context of the object,
on which they are called, so they can operate on its data (e.g. `name`, `health`, `strength`).

<details>
	<summary>Object context</summary>
	<div>
		In the future, you will learn that methods receive a "hidden" argument, called `this` (it is also a keyword),
		which is precisely the "context" of the object on which the method is called.
		Whenever you refer to a member field inside a method, e.g. `name`, it is equivalent to writing:

		```cpp
		this->name
		```

		You will learn more about pointers (including `this`) in future lessons.
	</div>
</details>

Calling methods on an object is done using the dot operator `.`, just like accessing member data:

```cpp
int main()
{
	Enemy boss;
	boss.name = "Ogre";
	boss.health = 250;
	boss.strength = 50;

	// highlight-next-line
	boss.attack();

	// highlight-next-line
	boss.run_away();
}
```

We also have the option to call other methods within the same structure:

```cpp title="Calling a method in a method"
void run_away()
{
	// first defense, then escape
	// highlight-next-line
	defend();
	std::cout << name << " is escaping!\n";
}
```

We will talk more about methods later in the course.

## Common problems

We have collected the following list of common problems that relate to using structures in the basic scope.

### Missing semicolon after definition

[Just as a reminder.](#semicolon-at-structure-end)

### Incorrect order

Make sure that the structure is defined **before** it is first used.

Example of **incorrect** code:

```cpp title="Incorrect order"
// ❌ Error: use of type "Enemy" before its definition
// error-next-line
void print_enemy_info(Enemy enemy)
{
	std::cout << enemy.name << " has "
		<< enemy.health		<< " hp and "
		<< enemy.strength	<< " strength."
		<< std::endl;
}

// Creating a structure
struct Enemy
{
	std::string name;
	float health;
	float strength;
};
```

Attempting to compile this program will result in a compilation error.

:::tip
This problem can be solved in a different, more convenient way than moving the `print_enemy_info` function
under the structure definition, using a forward declaration.
We will mention this later in the course.
:::

### Modifying inside structure definition

Variables **cannot** be modified inside the structure definition.
It is only possible to assign an initial value:

```cpp title="🔴 Attempt to modify a field in the wrong place"
struct Enemy
{
	std::string name;
	float health;
	float strength;

	int total_damage = 0; // OK ✅

	// ❌ Error: Attempt to modify a field in the wrong place
	// error-next-line
	health = 250;
};
```

### Uninitialized members

Make sure that all object data is initialized before use.
As with regular variables, uninitialized fields have a value that
we cannot predict, which can lead to unexpected program behavior.
Remember that such a program, despite violating the rules of C++, **will pass** the compilation stage.
Compilers and other tools often warn about such situations.

```cpp title="Uninitialized fields"
struct Enemy
{
	// ...
	// highlight-next-line
	float health; // ⚠️ No initial value
};

int main()
{
	Enemy boss;
	// ❌ Use of an uninitialized field
	// error-next-line
	std::cout << "Boss has " << boss.health << " health points.\n";
}
```
