# Structures

In this lesson, you learn how to create data types made up of many
smaller elements - what in C++ we call structures.

## Motivation

If, for example, when creating a game 🎮, we want to include opponents in our program,
we will usually have to write down some information about each of them.

Consider what data about the enemies in the game can be useful? It can be, for example:

- name 👾
- health 💚
- strength 💪

etc.

Using the knowledge we have acquired so far, if we wanted to write a program that stores this
information, we could do it like this:

```cpp
#include <string>

int main() {
	std::string	enemyName = "Goblin";
	float		enemyHealth = 50;
	float		enemyStrength = 12;
	// ...
}
```

When we want to have more opponents in the game, we will encounter a problem,
or rather inconvenience:

If we use multiple arrays for this purpose:

```cpp
std::vector< std::string >	enemyNames;
std::vector< float >		enemyHealth;
std::vector< float >		enemyStrength;
```

then each opponent will be described under the same index in these tables:

- `enemyNames[ index ]` describes the name
- `enemyHealth[ index ]` describes life points
- `enemyStrength[ index ]` describes the points of strength

:::important
This method involves "spreading" information about a single opponent across multiple tables.
:::

Adding one enemy to a set in such a program would look like this:

```cpp
enemyNames.push_back("Goblin");
enemyHealth.push_back(50);
enemyStrength.push_back(10);
```

The more information we want to store about our opponents, the more bothersome
it will be. Fortunately, **structures** come to our aid here.

## Creating structures

Let's recall what data we need to store:

- name 👾
- life 💚
- strength 💪

We are about to add a structure that allows us to create an object that contains these 3 things.

```cpp
#include <string>

struct Enemy
{
	std::string	name;
	float		health;
	float		strength;
};

int main()
{
	// We leave it empty for now
}
```

The above code introduces a new **structure** - `Enemy`.

:::important Remember
A **structure** is a description, a pattern, a recipe for how to create
an object (in this case, an enemy).
:::

To create a structure, we write its name after the `struct` keyword, then we put its contents
between the curly braces `{` and `}`.

The contents can be, for example, variables.

<div id="semicolon-at-structure-end" />

:::danger Semicolon
Note the **obligatory** semicolon after the curly braces to close the structure definition:
```cpp
struct Enemy
{
	std::string	name;
	float		health;
	float		strength;
	// highlight-next-line
};
```
:::

## Objects

Here's how to create an object that uses the `Enemy` structure
(which is treated as a formula for creating an object):

```cpp
// prism-push-types:Enemy
int main()
{
	Enemy boss;
}
```

Thus, we contained all these 3 fields (`name`, `health` and `strength`) inside one variable `boss`.

:::note Naming
From now on we will say that it `boss` is an object of the type `Enemy`.
This means that it was created using `Enemy` structure as a formula.
:::

### Accessing fields

As mentioned above, it `boss` contains 3 things (fields), i.e. it consists of three variables.
To get to a specific member of this object, we need to use the following notation:

```cpp title="Set the name of the boss to 'Ogre'"
boss.name = "Ogre";
```

We use a dot `.` to refer to the object's field. In the same way, we can e.g.
modify the enemy's *strength*:

```cpp title="Modifying the fields of an object"
boss.strength	= 50; // I set bosses strength to 50

// Boss enables "fury" skill - strength increases
// Health decreases by a half
boss.strength	+= 25;
boss.health		*= 0.5f;
```

... or display information about it:

```cpp title="Using object fields"
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

struct Enemy
{
	std::string	name;
	float		health;
	float		strength;
};

int main()
{
	// I create boss object
	Enemy boss;
	// I assign values to its fields
	boss.name		= "Ogre";
	boss.health		= 250;
	boss.strength	= 50;

	std::cout	<< boss.name		<< " has "
				<< boss.health		<< " hp and "
				<< boss.strength	<< " strength."
				<< std::endl;
}
```

### Passing objects to functions

Nothing prevents you from creating a function that takes an object of a certain structure
as a parameter. A good example will be just displaying information about an enemy:

```cpp title="A function that displays information about an opponent"
void printEnemyInfo(Enemy enemy)
{
	std::cout	<< enemy.name		<< " has "
				<< enemy.health		<< " hp and "
				<< enemy.strength	<< " strength."
				<< std::endl;
}
```

:::danger Order
`printEnemyInfo` requires a type `Enemy` to exist **before** the function itself is defined.
This means we need to put the function underneath the structure creation (see example below).
:::

Using the above information, we will create a "game" that will have two opponents:

- ordinary enemy 👹:  
**Goblin warrior**, `60` health, `14` strength

- boss 💀:  
**Ogre**, `250` health, `50` strength

<CustomCodeBlock maxLines={25}>

```cpp title="A fragment of a game code with an Ogre and a Goblin" showLineNumbers
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// Creating struct
struct Enemy
{
	std::string	name;
	float		health;
	float		strength;
};

// Function that display information about an enemy
void printEnemyInfo(Enemy enemy)
{
	std::cout	<< enemy.name		<< " has "
				<< enemy.health		<< " hp and "
				<< enemy.strength	<< " strength."
				<< std::endl;
}

// The main function
int main()
{
	// I create boss and goblin objects
	Enemy boss;
	Enemy goblin;

	// I setup goblin object fields
	goblin.name		= "Goblin warrior";
	goblin.health	= 60;
	goblin.strength	= 14;

	// I setup boss object fields
	boss.name		= "Ogre";
	boss.health		= 250;
	boss.strength	= 50;

	// and print information about them
	printEnemyInfo(goblin);
	printEnemyInfo(boss);
}
```

</CustomCodeBlock>

### Objects inside arrays

We can put objects inside arrays just like normal variables:

```cpp title="Vector of enemies"
std::vector< Enemy > enemies;
```

Below is an example of how to add to such an array:

```cpp title="Adding objects inside vector"
// ...

int main()
{
	std::vector< Enemy > enemies;

	// (optional)
	// A code block to limit the scope
	// of local variables inside
	{
		// I create goblin variable 👉 locally 👈
		Enemy goblin;
		// I setup the fields
		goblin.name		= "Goblin warrior";
		goblin.health	= 60;
		goblin.strength	= 14;

		// I add the object to the vector
		// highlight-next-line
		enemies.push_back( goblin );
	}
	// 👈 from this moment, goblin exists ONLY inside the vector

	// Print every enemy in the vector
	for (Enemy enemy : enemies)
		printEnemyInfo(enemy);
}
```

:::tip Example
After reading this lesson, review this sample program: [**👾 Battle Arena**](../example-programs/combat-arena)
and its overview. There you will see how arrays and structures are used in practice.
:::

### Default field values

We can give the structure elements default values, so we won't have to fill them in every time.

A good example of using the default value is a variable that stores the total amount of damage
an opponent has dealt. To start with, for each enemy, this value will have to be equal `0`.

:::caution Field values
If you leave the structure field with no default value , e.g .:
```cpp
struct Car
{
	int numberOfWheels;
};
```

it doesn't mean `numberOfWheels` will be set to `0` at the moment of object creation,
you have to do it **manually**!
:::

To assign a default value to a structure field, we use the usual initialization,
known for creating variables:

```cpp title="Default value for 'totalDamage' ⚔"
// Creating the structure
struct Enemy
{
	std::string	name;
	float		health;
	float		strength;

	// highlight-next-line
	float		totalDamage = 0;
};
```

Now when we create some enemy:

```cpp
Enemy snake; // snake as an example
```

then the value of its field `totalDamage`

```cpp
snake.totalDamage
```

will be set to `0` automatically.

You can find out about it, e.g. by printing it:

<Columns columns={['2fr', '1fr']}>
<div>


```cpp
int main() {
	Enemy snake;
	snake.name = "Snake";
	// 🟡 Note, I'm not setting "totalDamage" manually

	std::cout	<< snake.name
				<< " has dealt "
				<< snake.totalDamage
				<< " total damage";
}
```

</div>
<div>

```plaintext title="Result"
Snake has dealt 0 total damage
```

</div>
</Columns>

## Potential errors

<ImproveSection />

Here is a list of common errors related to this lesson:

### No semicolon after definition

[Just for the record.](#semicolon-at-structure-end)

### Invalid order

Make sure the structure is defined **before** using it for the first time.

**Wrong** code example:

```cpp title="🔴 Incorrect order"
// ❌ Error: usage of type "Enemy" before its definition
// error-next-line
void printEnemyInfo(Enemy enemy)
{
	std::cout	<< enemy.name		<< " has "
				<< enemy.health		<< " hp and "
				<< enemy.strength	<< " strength."
				<< std::endl;
}

// Creating the structure
struct Enemy
{
	std::string	name;
	float		health;
	float		strength;
};
```

:::tip
This problem can be solved in a different, more convenient way than moving the function
`printEnemyInfo` below the structure definition, with the so-called *forward declaration*.
We will mention it later in the course.
:::

### Modifying inside structure definition

Variables **cannot** be modified inside a structure definition.
It is only possible to assign an initial value:

```cpp title="🔴 Attempt to modify field in a wrong place"
struct Enemy
{
	std::string	name;
	float		health;
	float		strength;

	int			totalDamage = 0; // OK ✅

	// ❌ Error: Attempt to modify field in a wrong place
	// error-next-line
	health = 250;
};
```
