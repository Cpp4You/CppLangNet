# Lambda expressions

Lambda expression, more often just called "lambdas", are a convenient way to write a snippet of code in a form of an object,
so that it can be sent as a function argument and reused later.
Lambdas are mostly used for:
 - creating named objects inside functions, that can be later reused just like functions, without polutting the global namespace.
 - creating "anonymous" snippets of code that can be sent to other functions (e.g. standard library algorithms).

We recommend to look at [**Simple examples**](#simple-examples) and [**Practical usage**](#practical-usage) for some examples.

:::important *Anonymous functions, functors, function objects*
Lambdas are often called **anonymous functions**, **functors** or **function objects**.
None of these names are correct, although can be used when talking about lambdas.
Indeed, lambdas create an invisible object, although they are only expressions themselves.
Because of the way lambdas work (creating a magic, invisible object, of some magic, not-known type), to assign them to an object,
we need to use the keyword `auto`, or make use of the standard library type - `std::function` (we will learn about it further in the course).

## The syntax
<Image center

		desc={<></>}
	/>
<br/>

A lambda must have a body, in which we will write our code and a capture list (that can be empty).
The parameter list is optional, although very often used.
We can add various other things to the lambda expression, like attributes, explicit return type, etc.,
although they are neither mandatory nor often used, so we will talk about them further in the course.

#### Capture list
As we know from the lesson about functions, local variables (e.g. from the `main` function) are not known in the body of any other function.
The same thing applies to the lambda expressions. Local variables from a function are not visible inside a lambda expression,
that's why they need to be **captured** in the **capture list**.

<Columns spacing={40} columns={['7fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="A lambda with a capture list"
int five = 5;
auto get7 = [five] () { return five + 2; };

std::cout << get7();
```

</div>

<div>

```plaintext title="Result (console)"
7
```

</div>
</Columns>

:::note
In case of a lambda expression with an empty parameter list, the **parentheses** can be **ommited**.
```cpp
int five = 5;
auto get7 = [five] { return five + 2; };

std::cout << get7();
```
:::

:::caution Mutating the captured variables
The variables captured in the capture list **cannot** be changed for now.
There's a way to do that, but we will talk about it in the second course lesson.
:::

#### Parameter list

The parameter list in the lambda expression works just like the one we know from functions.
It allows us to declare with what parameters our lambda should be called, and then pass arguments to it.

<Columns spacing={40} columns={['7fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="A lambda with a parameter list."
auto multplyBy7 = [] (int a) { return a * 7; }; // a lambda with a parameter of type int
std::cout << multplyBy7(5); // the lambda called with an argument 5
```

</div>

<div>

```plaintext title="Result (console)"
35
```

</div>
</Columns>

#### The lambda body
Just a conventional code block, that we already know. Here we declare variables, make operations on objects, etc.
We can use the `return` statement inside the lambda body.

### Simple examples

#### A comparision of a lambda and a function returning 5 with every call

<Columns spacing={40} columns={['1fr', '1fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="Lambda"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	auto five = [] { return 5; };
	std::cout << five();
}
```

</div>

<div>

```cpp title="Function"
#include <iostream>

int five() 
{
	return 5;
}

int main()
{
	std::cout << five();
}
```

</div>
</Columns>

#### A lambda returning the square of its argument

<Columns spacing={40} columns={['7fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="Lambda expression with a parameter"
auto square = [](int x) { return x*x; };
std::cout << square(5);
```

</div>

<div>

```plaintext title="Result (console)"
25
```

</div>
</Columns>

#### Lambda used for code reusage

<Columns spacing={40} columns={['7fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="Lambda as a function in function"
void print3Hellos(std::string name) {
	auto print_hello = [name](std::string hello) {
		std::cout << hello << ", " << name << "!\n";
	}

	print_hello("Hello");
	print_hello("Welcome");
	print_hello("Hi");
}
// ...
print3Hellos("Mark");
```

</div>

<div>

```plaintext title="Result (console)"
Hello, Mark!
Welcome, Mark!
Hi, Mark!
```

</div>
</Columns>

## Common mistakes

### Trying to use a non-captured variable

```cpp title='Trying to use a non-captured variable'
int main()
{
	int A = 5;
	
	// highlight-start
	// ❌ Variable A is not known inside addToA ❌ 
	// auto addToA = [] (int b) { return A + b; };
	// highlight-end

	// highlight-start
	// ✅ Proper lambda declaration ✅
	auto addToA = [A] (int b) { return A + b; };
	std::cout << addToA(5) << "\n";
	// highlight-end
}
```

### Trying to modify a captured variable

```cpp title='Trying to modify a captured variable'
int main()
{
	int A = 5;
	
	// highlight-start
	// ❌ We can't modify the variable A ❌
	// auto addToA = [A] (int b) { A += b; };
	// highlight-end

	// highlight-start
	// ✅ For now, we can make use of the fact that we can return values.
	// You will learn how to modify captured variables later in the course. ✅
	auto addToA = [A] (int b) { return A + b; };
	std::cout << addToA(5) << "\n";
	// highlight-end
}
```

## Practical usage

:::caution C++ version
We suggest to use the newest C++ version (properly called a standard) - **C++20**,
because it provides a lot of convenient features.
If you can't use C++20 for some reason, we also provide examples that work on older versions.
:::

### Using a lambda with the **transform** algorithm

To use this algorithm, you have to include the `algorithm` header.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
```

#### The goal
In the example, we will create a vector of numbers and square every each of it with the use of the **transform** algorithm.

#### The way to go
The `transform` algorithm, can be passed a function, function object, or a lambda.
Since it's a lesson about lambdas, we will make use of them. Our lambda will take one parameter of type `int` and will return a value of the same type.

<SwitchView content={
		{
			"cpp20":		<TransformIntroExampleCpp20 />,
			"until-cpp20":	<TransformIntroExampleUntilCpp20 />,
		}
	}/>

We will learn more algorithms in the second lesson.
