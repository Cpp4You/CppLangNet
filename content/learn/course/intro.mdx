# Introduction to C++

:::important Before you start
You will need programmer tools for code editing.
<b>Visit <a href="/tools">Development tools</a>.</b>
:::

## The First Program

Once you have your editor ready, you can start writing your first program.

When learning a new programming language there is a tradition of starting with a program that writes "Hello, World!". Letâ€™s do just that!

Create a project in your editor.
A file called <Tooltip title={<>It could also be called <code>Source.cpp</code> or <code>ProjectName.cpp</code></>}>`main.cpp`</Tooltip> should have been created.
If it wasnâ€™t, create one and name it `main.cpp`

:::tip New files
If you don't know how to add a file to your project, see the <a href="/tools" target="_blank">tools</a>
section and find a tutorial for an editor of your choice.
:::

We will save all our code in this file for now.

### Application code

Copy the following code into your editor, compile it and then run it:

<Columns spacing={40} columns={['8fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="main.cpp"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Hello, World!";
}
```

</div>

<div>

```plaintext title="Result (console)"
Hello, World!
```

</div>
</Columns>


You should see an output like the one above.

You will find an explanation of the above code in the next lesson. ðŸ™‚
