# Introduction to C++

:::important Before you start
You will need programmer tools for code editing.

## The first program

Once you have your code editor ready, you can start writing your first program.

When learning a new programming language, the first thing you do
is a simple application that displays the following text: **"Hello, World!"**.

After creating the project, in your environment, a file with the extension `.cpp` has probably been automatically added.
Most often it is called `main.cpp` (sometimes `Source.cpp` or `ProjectName.cpp`).
If there is none, create one and name it `main.cpp`.
It is in it that we will save all the code for now.

### Application code

Paste the following code and run it:

<Columns spacing={40} columns={['8fr', '4fr']}>
<div>

```cpp title="main.cpp"
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
	std::cout << "Hello, World!";
}
```

</div>

<div>

```plaintext title="Result (console)"
Hello, World!
```

</div>
</Columns>


You should see an effect like the one above.

You will find an explanation of the above code in the next part of the course 🙂
