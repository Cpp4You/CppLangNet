This is an alias type defined within the class definition. Example:
```cpp
using reverse_iterator			= /* some type */;
using const_reverse_iterator	= /* some type */;
```

They act like normal iterators, but traverse a container in reverse order.
`reverse_iterator` allows to change the pointed-to elements, `const_reverse_iterator` doesn't.
