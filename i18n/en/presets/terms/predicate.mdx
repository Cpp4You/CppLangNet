A predicate is a function, lambda or a function object that accepts a number of arguments, tests them again a certain condition and returns either `true` or `false.`
The C++ standard only mentions **unary** predicates (taking one argument) and **binary** predicates (taking two arguments).
They are often useful when, for example, we only want to remove/copy/transform or otherwise act on elements from a container that meet a certain condition.
