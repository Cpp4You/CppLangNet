<b>Undefined behaviour</b> is a property of a program that's incorrect, but likely compiles.
It is incorrect in a way, that the error is only invoked in certain conditions at runtime.

Common cases include: **out of bounds access**, **reading uninitialized objects**, **dangling pointers/references** or **signed overflow**.
